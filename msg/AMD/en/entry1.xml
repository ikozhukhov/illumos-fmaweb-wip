	<item>This message indicates that the Solaris Fault Manager has received reports 
that correctable memory errors attributed to a single page of physical 
memory have been detected. Ongoing diagnosis applied to the error reports has 
determined that a page is faulty. No repair action is required or recommended 
at this time. No data has been lost. If and when the Solaris Fault Manager 
determines that there is sufficient cause, service action will be recommended 
at that time.</item>
