	<item>Online any CPU that was automatically offlined in response to this fault
(use fmdump -v -u &amp;lt;EVENT_ID&amp;gt; to identify the CPU).  The fault
should also be repaired with fmadm repair &amp;lt;EVENT_ID&amp;gt;.
This misdiagnosis bug is being fixed - patch numbers for Solaris 10

	<name>description</name>
	<item>(This is a misdiagnosis of a potential main memory (DIMM) fault as a CPU cache fault.  Ignore this fault and look for memory errors and faults from the DIMMS associated with this CPU.)
</item>
	<name>details</name>
	<item> This is a misdiagnosis resulting from attributing certain errors reported by per-core caches to those caches rather than to their real source which is ECC errors from DIMMs associated with this CPU.  If a DIMM is indeed faulty then other ECC error telemetry detected at the NorthBridge will correctly diagnose a DIMM error (it may just take a little longer since a fraction of the telemetry arising from the fault is being misdiagnosed).
