	<item>Schedule system maintenance time as soon as possible and investigate the affected DRAM channel.  Use &#39;fmadm faulty&#39; to identify the channel.\n</item>
	<name>description</name>
	<item>A memory channel is experiencing errors from sources outside of the memory modules (DIMMs).
</item>
	<name>details</name>
	<item>A fault in the dram channel itself and likely not the memory modules of this channel. The fault cannot readily be isolated to a single resource with the telemetry available. The fault may lie in the on-chip DRAM controller, on or around a DIMM socket associated with this DRAM channel, on the motherboard itself, or possibly even a DIMM on the channel. Further investigation is required to isolate the fault.
</item>
	<name>impact</name>
	<item>A faulty DRAM channel could lead to large numbers of correctable errors, some uncorrectable errors which will affect system availability, and perhaps even some undetectable errors and consequent data corruption.
</item>
	<name>response</name>
	<item>None - there is no hardware resource that the system can disable to attempt to isolate this fault.
