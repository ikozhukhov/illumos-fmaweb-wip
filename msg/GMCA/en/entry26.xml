	<item>This message ID: &lt;B&gt;GMCA-8000-T0&lt;/B&gt; indicates that the %DISTRO% Fault 
Manager has received errors reported by a bus or interconnect 
(typically IO or memory errors) that have exceeded acceptable levels.
Further investigation needed to determine the cause of the fault.
&lt;P&gt;
Please collect additional data to identify the faulty component. Follow
the steps below.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Step 1: &lt;/B&gt; Use fmadm (1M) &lt;tt&gt;faulty&lt;/tt&gt; that lists the chip that 
detected the errors, identify unique Event_ID string, and Sun Message_ID.&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;BR&gt; See Example 1.1 for details.
&lt;P&gt;
LEGEND:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;  GREEN = CHIP THAT DETECTED ERROR &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;   BLUE = EVENT_ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;    RED = SUNW-MSG-ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Example 1.1 - finding chip that detected error, Event_ID, and Sun Message_ID&lt;/B&gt;

Description : Errors reported by a bus or interconnect (typically IO or memory
              errors) have exceeded acceptable levels  Refer to
              %FMAURL%/GMCA-8000-T0 for more information.

Response    : No automated response action is possible

Impact      : None (no automated response)

Action      : Additional manual investigation is required to determine the root
              cause of the fault.  Use &#39;fmadm faulty&#39; to see which chip
              *detected* the errors (it is likely not the cause of them).
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Step 2: &lt;/B&gt; As additional manual investigation is required to determine
the faulty component. Please take the information gathered above and contact
