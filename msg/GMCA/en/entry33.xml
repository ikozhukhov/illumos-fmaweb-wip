	<item>This message ID: &lt;B&gt;GMCA-8001-1N&lt;/B&gt; indicates that the %DISTRO% Fault Manager has received 
reports from a CPU indicating that memory controller errors have occurred 
with this resource resulting in a CPU fault being diagnosed. If an
uncorrectable error was reported, it likely resulted in a system panic
or reset followed by a reboot.  If the errors were correctable, they 
have occurred at a rate exceeding acceptable levels. There should have 
been no operational impact on system or application activity from 
correctable errors.
&lt;P&gt;
The recommended service action for this event is to schedule replacement 
of the affected CPU at the earliest possible convenience. The faulted
CPU has been off-lined to prevent further disruption to system availability.
However it is not intended nor recommended that the faulted FRU remain 
in the system for a prolonged period of time.
&lt;p&gt;
Identifying and replace the fauty FRU
&lt;P&gt;
Follow the procedure below
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Step 1: &lt;/B&gt; Use fmadm (1M) &lt;tt&gt;faulty&lt;/tt&gt; to List Faulty FRUs, identify unique Event_ID
string, and Sun Message_ID.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; See Example 1.1 for details.
&lt;p&gt;
LEGEND:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;  GREEN = FRU&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;   BLUE = EVENT_ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;    RED = SUNW-MSG-ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Example 1.1 - finding faulty FRU, Event_ID, and Sun Message_ID&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;

Description : Error detected in memory controller.  Refer to
              %FMAURL%/&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;red&quot;&gt;GMCA-8001-1N&lt;/FONT&gt; for more information.

Response    : Error detected in memory controller

Impact      : System may experience stability or performance problems

Action      : Investigate memory error. Use &#39;fmadm faulty&#39; to identify FRU if
              one has been identified.
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
As seen in Example 1.1 The FRU is identified as motherboard=0/&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;green&quot;&gt;chip=0&lt;/FONT&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
The term &#39;chip&#39; used in the output above can also be used to refer
to a processor or CPU chip, hence &#39;chip=x&#39; equates to &#39;CPU chipx&#39;.
Note that the cpuid refers to a logical CPU number within the CPU 
chip.
&lt;P&gt;
chip=x maps to the processor chip labeled within the system.
&lt;BR&gt;The CPU socket for chip=x will usually have a physical label of
CPU#, CHIP#, P#...
&lt;P&gt;
For example:
&lt;UL&gt;
chip=0 maps to the physical location labeled; CPU0, CHIP0, P0...
&lt;BR&gt;chip=1 maps to the physical location labeled; CPU1, CHIP1, P1...
&lt;p&gt;
In this example replace chip labeled CPU0, CHIP0, P0...
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Step 2: &lt;/B&gt;Replace chip labeled CPU0, CHIP0, P0...(and reboot the system)
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Refer to the service label or hardware maintenance manual for correct 
replacement procedures.
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Step 3: &lt;/B&gt;Update the Fault Manager&#39;s resource cache to indicate
that no problems are present in the resources that had been diagnosed
faulty and subsequently replaced in Step 2.
&lt;P&gt;
Once the CPU has been physically replaced and the system rebooted,
you must invoke the &#39;fmadm repair&#39; command using the UUID (Universally 
Unique IDentifier) to identify the repaired FRU.  The UUID is synonymous
with the EVENT_ID (highlighted in blue) in Example 1.1 above.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Example 3.1 - Updating the Fault Manager&#39;s resource cache:&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;
# fmadm repair &lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;54b3cdff-66f3-ecc5-9614-92cb1997a2ae&lt;/FONT&gt;
# fmadm: recorded repair to &lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;54b3cdff-66f3-ecc5-9614-92cb1997a2ae&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Step 4: &lt;/B&gt;Bring the faulted resource back online by placing the
          CPU back into the active configuration.
&lt;P&gt;
Once you have completed the repair action, and told the fault manager 
that the FRU has been repaired, it may still be necessary to tell %DISTRO% 
to use the affected system resource.  If the &lt;B&gt;Automated Response&lt;/B&gt; 
described above in this article was; &quot;An attempt will be made to remove 
this CPU from service.&quot;, you will need to place the CPU back into the 
active configuration and verify that the CPU has been returned to service.
&lt;P&gt;
Use %DISTRO% command psrinfo (1M) to identify the logical CPU number that
was faulted. Example 4.1 below.  
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Example 4.1 - identifying the logical CPU number that was faulted:&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;PRE&gt;
# psrinfo
0       faulted   since 09/22/2008 14:34:31
1       on-line   since 09/22/2008 14:31:30
2       on-line   since 09/22/2008 14:34:32
3       on-line   since 09/22/2008 14:34:34
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Place the faulted CPU back into the active configuration using the psradm 
(1M) command; &#39;psradm -F -n x&#39; where x is the logical cpuid.  As logical CPU 
0 was identified as the faulted CPU, the psradm (1M) command shown in Example 
4.2 below will return it to the active configuration.
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Example 4.2 - returning the repaired CPU to the active configuration:&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;PRE&gt;
# psradm -F -n 0
&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Step 5: &lt;/B&gt;Verify the CPU is in use by the system.
&lt;P&gt;
To verify that the CPU has been returned to service, use the %DISTRO% 
command psrinfo (1M). See Example 5.1 below.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Example 5.1 - verifying the CPU has returned to service:&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;
# psrinfo
0       on-line   since 09/22/2008 14:45:16
1       on-line   since 09/22/2008 14:44:19
2       on-line   since 09/22/2008 14:44:57
3       on-line   since 09/22/2008 14:44:23
