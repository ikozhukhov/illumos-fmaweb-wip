	<item>This message indicates that the Solaris Fault Manager has received 
reports of single bit correctable errors from a Memory Module at a 
rate exceeding acceptable levels, and a Memory Module fault has been 
diagnosed. No data has been lost, and pages of the affected Memory 
Module are being retired as errors are encountered.  The recommended 
service action for this event is to schedule replacement of the 
affected Memory Module at the earliest possible convenience. The errors 
are correctable in nature so they do not present an immediate threat to 
system availability. Use &#39;fmadm faulty&#39; to identify the dimm to replace.</item>
