	<item>The I/O Expansion Unit should never be connected to two different host systems and is considered a
faulty configuration.

The centerplane and power supply FRUID&#39;s may be accessed via either I/O boat. If there is a different
system connected to each boat they may attempt to read or write information to one of these FRU&#39;s
while the other &#39;host&#39; is doing the same. If both systems attempt to update FRUID data, the records
may become corrupted. For this reason dual-hosting is not supported.&lt;p&gt;

If there are two hosts attached to this I/O Expansion Unit then one of them should be removed.
(Note: They may be attached to two different logical domains but must be on the same physical host)
If both boats are connected to a single host system, then one of the boats is not detected by the Service
Processor. Physically locate the linkcards in the host system attached to the box to determine if
communication to one of the linkcards is not functioning correctly. This problem can also be caused
by a corrupted FRUID in the chassis preventing the host software from identify the correct box for
both installed boats.&lt;p&gt;

If a second boat is not installed in the system, there is a failure on the centerplane and the chassis
should be replaced.&lt;p&gt;

Follow the steps below to obtain the necessary data for presentation to your authorized service
provider.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt; Collect the fault message.&lt;br&gt;
A single line fault message is displayed to the system console and logged in the /var/logs/message file.
The complete message may be retrieved by using the &#39;fmdump&#39; command on the XSCF console as
shown below.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
LEGEND:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;    RED = SUNW-MSG-ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;   BLUE = EVENT_ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;  GREEN = FRU&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;i&gt; XSCF&gt; fmdump -m&lt;/i&gt;
   MSG-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8000-U4&lt;/font&gt;, TYPE: Fault, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Major
   EVENT-TIME: Tue Mar 27 05:43:34 PDT 2007
   PLATFORM: SPARC-Enterprise, CSN: BE80601000, HOSTNAME: server-0
   SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.12
   EVENT-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;22b286f8-b174-441f-b240-195d94e93802&lt;/font&gt;
   DESC: Both I/O boats are not being managed by the same host system
   Refer to http://www.sun.com/msg/&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8000-U4&lt;/font&gt; for more information.
   AUTO-RESPONSE: No immediate action is taken
   IMPACT: FRUID data may be corrupted or hardware is not being monitored
   REC-ACTION: Physically examine the chassis to determine if it is shared by two different host platforms.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 2:&lt;/b&gt; Collect the &quot;fmdump&quot; output.&lt;br&gt;
Use the fmdump command with the Event-ID option to retrieve more information on the fault which
has occurred.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;i&gt; XSCF&gt; fmdump -v -u &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;22b286f8-b174-441f-b240-195d94e93802&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 3:&lt;/b&gt; Provide the output collected to your service provider.&lt;br&gt;
The information collected above will help your service provider to schedule a repair at your
convenience.</item>
