	<item>There is a failure with a FRU presence signal
or I/O boat location signal in an External I/O Expansion Unit.
</item>
	<name>details</name>
	<item>One of the presence signals has failed. Signals for this diagnosis are comprised of both presence
signals and also FRU location signals. These signals span multiple FRUs.
A failed PSU presence signals will result in the chassis appearing to be a single PSU system. The
green LED&#39;s in the PSU will be on but the others will remain off. The fans will remain at high speed in
both PSU&#39;s.&lt;p&gt;
If a FRU was recently replaced, this fault is likely due to a bent pin. If the system has been running
before this message appeared then fault may have occurred in the ASIC which accepts the signal. If a
bent pin is seen via inspection, note the FRU containing it and report it along with the other
information gathered below.&lt;p&gt;
Follow the steps below to obtain the necessary data for presentation to your authorized service
provider.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt; Collect the fault message.&lt;br&gt;
A single line fault message is displayed to the system console and logged in the /var/logs/message file.
The complete message may be retrieved by using the &#39;fmdump&#39; command on the XSCF console as
shown below.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
LEGEND:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;    RED = SUNW-MSG-ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;   BLUE = EVENT_ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;  GREEN = FRU&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;i&gt;XSCF&gt; fmdump -m&lt;/i&gt;
MSG-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8000-35&lt;/font&gt;, TYPE: Fault, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Major
EVENT-TIME: Tue Mar 27 05:50:22 PDT 2007
PLATFORM: SPARC-Enterprise, CSN: BE80601000, HOSTNAME: server-0
SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.12
EVENT-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;383a648e-f537-4426-8058-c8f735007b23&lt;/font&gt;
DESC: There is a failure with a FRU presence signal
or I/O boat location signal in an External I/O Expansion Unit.
Refer to http://www.sun.com/msg/&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8000-35&lt;/font&gt; for more information.
AUTO-RESPONSE: No immediate action is taken
IMPACT: Hardware may not be monitored by the system.
REC-ACTION: Schedule a repair procedure to replace the affected FRU.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 2:&lt;/b&gt; Collect the &quot;fmdump&quot; output.&lt;br&gt;
Use the fmdump command with the Event-ID option to retrieve more information on the fault which
has occurred.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;i&gt;XSCF&gt; fmdump -v -u &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;383a648e-f537-4426-8058-c8f735007b23&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
