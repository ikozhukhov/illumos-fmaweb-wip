	<item>An over-current warning was detected in a power supply
</item>
	<name>details</name>
	<item>A power supply is experiencing a persistent over-current warning. This indicates excessive current
draw on the supply from within the I/O Expansion Unit. This can be caused by a short in the system, or
using too many high-power I/O cards. This is not caused by a current spike entering the system.&lt;p&gt;

Follow the steps below to obtain the necessary data for presentation to your authorized service
provider.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt;  Collect the fault message.&lt;br&gt;
A single line fault message is displayed to the system console and logged in the /var/logs/message file.
The complete message may be retrieved by using the &#39;fmdump&#39; command on the XSCF console as
shown below.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
LEGEND:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;    RED = SUNW-MSG-ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;   BLUE = EVENT_ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;  GREEN = FRU&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;i&gt;XSCF&gt; fmdump -m&lt;/i&gt;
   MSG-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8000-YE&lt;/font&gt;, TYPE: Fault, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Major
   EVENT-TIME: Tue Mar 27 10:28:25 PDT 2007
   PLATFORM: SPARC-Enterprise, CSN: BE80601000, HOSTNAME: server-0
   SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.12
   EVENT-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;e8986c1a-d4af-4a7f-bea4-bf2ab8a984aa&lt;/font&gt;
   DESC: An over-current warning was detected in a power supply
   Refer to %FMAURL%/&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8000-YE&lt;/font&gt; for more information.
   AUTO-RESPONSE: No immediate action is taken
   IMPACT: No immediate impact to the system. This warning may precede a power failure.
   REC-ACTION: Verify that the configuration of the I/O boats are supported, and
   that the total current draw of the installed IO cards is within spec. If
   nothing further is found, please open a case with your authorized service
   provider to assist with further analysis.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 2:&lt;/b&gt; Collect the &quot;fmdump&quot; output.&lt;br&gt;

Use the fmdump command with the Event-ID option to retrieve more information on the fault which
has occurred.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;i&gt;XSCF&gt; fmdump -v -u &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;e8986c1a-d4af-4a7f-bea4-bf2ab8a984aa&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
   TIME                 UUID                                 MSG-ID
   Mar 27 10:28:25.9254 &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;e8986c1a-d4af-4a7f-bea4-bf2ab8a984aa&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8000-YE&lt;/font&gt;
