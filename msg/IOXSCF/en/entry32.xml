	<item>A power failure was detected in an External I/O Expansion Unit FRU
</item>
	<name>details</name>
	<item>A failure was detected within one of the system power supplies or associated with an internal power
rail. This failure was the result of detecting an over current or an over voltage condition. Voltage
failures in the boat may cause the host to power off the associated downlink card slot causing the unit
to be unreachable. ( you may not be able to gather info via the &quot;ioxadm&quot; command)&lt;p&gt;

If the failure is in the PSU it will be shut down and the fault LED will be lit. You will also see it listed
with state= On in the &#39;ioxadm -v list&#39;, the &#39;fmtopo -f&#39; command should show it as &#39;Faulted&#39;.&lt;p&gt;

A rail failure will be located within the IO boats and will cause it to shut down to prevent damage and
possible data corruption. In this case the PSU&#39;s will be functioning normally.&lt;p&gt;

Follow the steps below to obtain the necessary data for presentation to your authorized service
provider.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt;  Collect the fault message.&lt;br&gt;
A single line fault message is displayed to the system console and logged in the /var/logs/message file.
The complete message may be retrieved by using the &#39;fmdump&#39; command on the XSCF console as
shown below.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
LEGEND:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;    RED = SUNW-MSG-ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;   BLUE = EVENT_ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;  GREEN = FRU&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;i&gt; XSCF&gt; fmdump -m&lt;/i&gt;
   MSG-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8001-0J&lt;/font&gt;, TYPE: Fault, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Critical
   EVENT-TIME: Tue Mar 27 06:13:24 PDT 2007
   PLATFORM: SPARC-Enterprise, CSN: BE80601000, HOSTNAME: server-0
   SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.12
   EVENT-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;f8f35515-327a-45ca-85ae-1d561d734d25&lt;/font&gt;
   DESC: A power failure was detected in an External I/O Expansion Unit FRU
   Refer to %FMAURL%/&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8001-0J&lt;/font&gt; for more information.
   AUTO-RESPONSE: No immediate action is taken
   IMPACT: If one power supply fails, the redundant supply will provide
   power to the system. If a power failure occurred in an I/O
   boat, all PCI-Express and PCI-X devices are powered off and
   the domain may panic.
   REC-ACTION: Schedule a repair procedure to replace the affected FRU.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 2:&lt;/b&gt; Collect the &quot;fmdump&quot; output.&lt;br&gt;
Use the fmdump command with the Event-ID option to retrieve more information on the fault which
has occurred.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;i&gt;XSCF&gt; fmdump -v -u &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;f8f35515-327a-45ca-85ae-1d561d734d25&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
   TIME                 UUID                                 MSG-ID

&lt;b&gt;Step 3:&lt;/b&gt; Provide the output collected to your service provider.&lt;br&gt;
The information collected above will help your service provider to schedule a repair at your
convenience.</item>
