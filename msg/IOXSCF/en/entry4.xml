	<item>The static area of a FRUID seeprom is corrupted
</item>
	<name>details</name>
	<item>The static portion of the FRUID is corrupted. This could result in incorrect FRU identity information
being retrieved from it. It is possible that datapaths associated with this FRU could be disabled. It is
likely that the datapaths will not be included in your system after the next reboot. There is no danger of
corruption to the data itself.&lt;p&gt;
The FRU containing this ASIC will be called out for replacement though no serial number information
will be given. If the failing FRUID is located in the centerplane it cannot call out the chassis in which
its contained. Should this be the case the chassis may have to be located by tracing from the downlink
card location called out in the FRU path.&lt;p&gt;
You may also see a configuration errors since two IO boats may seen to be located within an unknown
Chassis.&lt;p&gt;
Follow the steps below to obtain the necessary data for presentation to your authorized service
provider.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt; Collect the fault message.&lt;br&gt;
A single line fault message is displayed to the system console and logged in the /var/logs/message file.
The complete message may be retrieved by using the &#39;fmdump&#39; command on the XSCF console as
shown below.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
LEGEND:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;    RED = SUNW-MSG-ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;   BLUE = EVENT_ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;  GREEN = FRU&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;i&gt; XSCF&gt; fmdump -m&lt;/i&gt;
   MSG-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8000-4Y&lt;/font&gt;, TYPE: Fault, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Minor
   EVENT-TIME: Tue Mar 27 05:28:05 PDT 2007
   PLATFORM: SPARC-Enterprise, CSN: BE80601000, HOSTNAME: server-0
   SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.12
   EVENT-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;cc2379c7-00d6-438d-a60a-9c18a6fbea8a&lt;/font&gt;
   DESC: The static area of a FRUID seeprom is corrupted
   Refer to %FMAURL%/&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8000-4Y&lt;/font&gt; for more information.
   AUTO-RESPONSE: No immediate action is taken
   IMPACT: FRUID updates may not be available. Service Processor software
   may disable use of the datapath associated with the FRU if the FRU type cannot be determined.
   REC-ACTION: Schedule a repair procedure to replace the affected FRU.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 2:&lt;/b&gt; Collect the &quot;fmdump&quot; output.&lt;br&gt;
Use the fmdump command with the Event-ID option to retrieve more information on the fault which
has occurred.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;i&gt;XSCF&gt; fmdump -v -u &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;cc2379c7-00d6-438d-a60a-9c18a6fbea8a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 3:&lt;/b&gt; Provide the output collected to your service provider.&lt;br&gt;
The information collected above will help your service provider to schedule a repair at your
convenience.</item>
