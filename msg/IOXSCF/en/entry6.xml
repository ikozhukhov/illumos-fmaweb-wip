	<item>There are communication failures on the management bus in an External I/O Expansion Unit FRU
</item>
	<name>details</name>
	<item>The Service Processor cannot communicate with devices in an I/O Expansion Unit. FRUs will not be
monitored. Alarm conditions will not be detected. Also, devices along the indicated path will not be
included into your system after the next reboot.&lt;p&gt;

There are numerous causes for this failure including:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#9679; A disconnected cable. This is the most likely cause. Verify that both ends of the cable are
securely attached and run an &#39;ioxadm list&#39; command to test the bus.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#9679; A unit has been accidentally powered off and may not be able to retrieve data. Verify that all
units are powered on and run an &#39;ioxadm list&#39; command to test the bus.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#9679; A failure in the uplink or downlink card. Use the &#39;fmdump&#39; command as shown in the example
below to verify if other failures exist.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#9679; A failure in the host PCIe slot could also generate this fault as a follow-on failure. Use the
&#39;fmdump&#39; command as shown in the example below to verify if other failures exist.&lt;p&gt;

If multiple failures exist, all units were powered on and no connectivity issues were found you should
follow the steps below to obtain the necessary data for presentation to your authorized service provider.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt; Collect the fault message(s).&lt;br&gt;
A single line fault message is displayed to the system console and logged in the /var/logs/message file.
The complete message may be retrieved by using the &#39;fmdump&#39; command on the XSCF console as
shown below.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
LEGEND:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;    RED = SUNW-MSG-ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;   BLUE = EVENT_ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;  GREEN = FRU&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt; &lt;i&gt;XSCF&gt; fmdump -m&lt;/i&gt;
   MSG-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8000-6H&lt;/font&gt;, TYPE: Fault, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Major
   EVENT-TIME: Tue Mar 27 08:55:29 PDT 2007
   PLATFORM: SPARC-Enterprise, CSN: BE80601000, HOSTNAME: server-0
   SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.12
   EVENT-ID: &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;2528da47-6ae9-48de-b3ea-46e8479f46de&lt;/font&gt;
   DESC: There are communication failures on the management bus in an External I/O Expansion Unit FRU
   Refer to %FMAURL%/&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;IOXSCF-8000-6H&lt;/font&gt; for more information.
   AUTO-RESPONSE: No immediate action is taken
   IMPACT: External I/O Expansion Unit FRUS may no longer be monitored. 
   They also may not be discovered at the next reboot.
   REC-ACTION: Schedule a repair procedure to replace the affected FRU.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 2:&lt;/b&gt; Collect the &quot;fmdump&quot; output.&lt;br&gt;
Use the fmdump command with the Event-ID option to retrieve more information on the fault which
has occurred.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; &lt;i&gt;XSCF&gt; fmdump -v -u &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;2528da47-6ae9-48de-b3ea-46e8479f46de&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 3:&lt;/b&gt; Provide the output collected to your service provider.&lt;br&gt;
The information collected above will help your service provider to schedule a repair at your
convenience.</item>
