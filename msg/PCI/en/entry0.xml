	<item>The system has diagnosed a problem in one or more PCI controller 
drivers, based on the error telemetry detected in the PCI subsystem.</item>
	<name>details</name>
	<item>The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
indicates a problem with a PCI driver.  This message occurs 
primarily when a PCI service was used that had not been enabled.  This could
be the result of a nexus,driver or application bug.
&lt;p&gt;
Use the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;fmdump -v -u &lt;i&gt;EVENT_ID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; command to 
determine the possible faulty driver(s) as shown in the example below.

&lt;p&gt;
The defective software module is indicated in the &lt;b&gt;rsrc&lt;/b&gt; line as the &lt;b&gt;mod-name.&lt;/b&gt;
Make note of the module(s) indicated (&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;pcisch&lt;/b&gt; above&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) and go
