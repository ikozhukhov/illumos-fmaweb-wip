	<item>The system has diagnosed a problem in one or more PCI buses or devices,

	<item>The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
indicates a problem with a device on the PCI bus which requires service.

&lt;p&gt;
The fault is caused by a PCI device in the system.  If that device 
is contained with the Motherboard then the Motherboard will be indicted.
If the device is in a slot then the slot will be called out.

Use the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;fmdump -v -u &lt;i&gt;EVENT_ID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; command to determine 
the faulty components as shown in the example below. The faulty component
is specified in the &lt;b&gt;FRU:&lt;/b&gt; field of the output as shown:

&lt;pre&gt;
# fmdump -v -u f3b6c67b-45ac-6dcf-d88c-f7f1ffdf0bf9
TIME                 UUID                                 SUNW-MSG-ID

  100%  fault.io.pci.device
         FRU: hc://product-id=SUNW,Sun-Fire-880/component=/pci@9,600000:&lt;U&gt;PCI8&lt;/U&gt;
        rsrc: hc:///motherboard=0/hostbridge=1/pcibus=0/pcidev=1/pcifn=0

&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example, the failing device is in &lt;b&gt;PCI Slot 8&lt;/b&gt;.  
Have this information available when contacting Sun Services for a repair.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; You may also be requested to provide a copy of the files in the 
/var/fm/fmd directory and also a copy of the output from the 
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;fmadm config&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; command.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; If you have encountered this problem on a 
Sun Blade 1000 system, reported FRUs may be mislabeled.
Please reference the following SRDB (Symptom Resolution Data Base)
