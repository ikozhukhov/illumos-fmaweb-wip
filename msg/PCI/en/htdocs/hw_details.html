The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1"><tt><b>%MSGID%</b></tt></font>
indicates a problem with a device on the PCI bus.  The faulty component(s),
as shown with <tt><b>fmdump</b></tt>, should be repaired in order to
restore the system.
<p>
Arrangements should be made to replace the Field Replaceable Unit (FRU)
on which the suspect device is located.  Refer to the information displayed
in the FRU: field of the fmdump output.  For example: 
<p>
<ul>
<tt>FRU: hc://product-id=SUNW,Sun-Fire-280R/motherboard=0</tt>
</ul>
<p>
If there are multiple FRU's indicted, the FRU with the highest probability 
should be replaced first.
