	<item>The transmitting device sent an invalid request.
&lt;p&gt;
This message occurs when a PCI driver queries a component which does 
not  does not support the request.  The request was correctly formed 
and has not incurred any detected error during transport, however  
the transaction cannot be fulfilled due to a variety of reasons 
including illegal access, improper address or invalid command for this 
device.
&lt;p&gt;  
This is most likely caused by a piece of software that is not aligned 
with the capabilities of the PCI component(s) pointed to by this message.
The component(s) are listed in the &quot;Affects&quot; portion it&#39;s location 
is listed in the &quot;FRU&quot; portion of 
&quot;fmadm faulty&quot; or &quot;fmdump&quot; output.
&lt;p&gt;
It is extremely unlikely that this is a hardware problem and replacing 
hardware is not warranted unless it is verified that software is 
not the root cause.
&lt;p&gt;
Verify that the patches associated with the component(s) and FRU(s) 
are up to date.  
This should include OS level PCI driver patches as well as 
any potential firmware patches for the device itself.  
Apply current versions of any patches not up to date to reduce the 
potential of this error re-occurring.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Step 1: &lt;/B&gt;Find the 36 character EVENT_ID string associated with the
fault.  
&lt;P&gt;
The EVENT_ID can be located using either the fmdump (1M) or fmadm (1M) 
commands or from the fault message 
displayed in the console output at the time of the fault. 
fmdump output is shown in Example 1.1 below.
&lt;P&gt;
Note: Be sure to get the correct 36 character EVENT_ID string if more
than one is listed.  You can identify the correct string by associating
the fault with the date and time stamp from the fmdump output. fmadm faulty shows the EVENT_ID (highlighted
in blue).
&lt;P&gt;
LEGEND:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;    RED = SUNW-MSG-ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;   BLUE = EVENT_ID&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color = &quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;  GREEN = FRU&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Example 1.1 - finding the EVENT_ID (36 character string):&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;
# fmdump

&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Step 2: &lt;/B&gt;Use the command; fmadm faulty -u &lt;I&gt;EVENT_ID&lt;/I&gt;, to locate the  
affected components (highlighted in green), where &lt;I&gt;EVENT_ID&lt;/I&gt; consists of the 36 character string 
obtained in Step 1 above. The component is located on the FRU (highlighted in green) See Example 2.1 below.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Example 2.1 - determining affected component(s):&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;
# fmadm faulty -u &lt;FONT COLOR=BLUE&gt;eccf460a-968b-e005-85ac-aecb6e4b7214&lt;/FONT&gt;

              faulty 




&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Step 3: &lt;/B&gt;Identify the software component(s) that needs to be repaired.
&lt;P&gt;
Software under suspicion in this example would be associated with the
hardware components listed in the &quot;Affects&quot; field of the output, in 
this example ethernet or else the QLC chip on the motherboard.  
Note that both are PCI and not PCIe.  
Any drivers or firmware for either component need 
to be checked for currency. Check &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunsolve.sun.com/show.do?target=home&quot;&gt;&quot;SunSolve&quot;&lt;/a&gt; 
patch finder for patches with
pci and, in this example, ethernet and qlc keywords to search 
for possible updated patches. 
&lt;P&gt;
If patches are applied, run the command; fmadm repair &lt;I&gt;EVENT_ID&lt;/I&gt;
in order to clear the fault staus of the hardware components.
&lt;P&gt;
In the case that there are no patches, the applicable patches 
are current or if the problem reappears after applying patches, 
contact your service provider with the above information.  
Your service provider may request additional information to attempt
to further isolate the issue.
