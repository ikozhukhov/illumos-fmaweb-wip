This directory contains FMA event message information.  The information
in this area is related to suspect lists, or diagnoses -- for example,
each diagnosis printed by Solaris refers to an article on Sun's web site:

	http://sun.com/msg/<message-id>

Those articles come directly from the information in this area, as do
the FMA .dict and .po files.

See http://events.central/docs/layout.html for more information.

Things found in this directory:

README

	This file.

en

	Localized common information.  For example, the file
	"en/defaults.xml" contains English default property values.
	These defaults apply to the entire directory tree from here
	on down, so they take effect when a property is not found
	in a lower down defaults.xml, or in a lower down properties.xml
	or entry<N>.xml file.

	Any two-letter directory at this level is assumed to contain
	localized information for the locale represented by the two-letter
	directory name.

htdocs

	Common HTML and related information for the http://sun.com/msg
	web site.  The files in this directory end up at the top-level
	of the sun.com/msg website.

templates

	Template HTML files used by the http://sun.com/msg website when
	displaying an article.

SCA1000

	These directories are event message dictionary names.  Each one
	contains some number of entries (files called "entry0.xml",
	"entry1.xml" and so on) and a "properties.xml" file containing
	properties that apply to the entire dictionary.

	In addition, each of these subdirectories contained localized
	information as well, which lives in the two-letter directory
	named after the locale name.  For example, the directory:
		FMD/en
	contains English information for the entries in the FMD dictionary.
	The English information for entry zero is in the file:
		FMD/en/entry0.xml

	As necessary, the directories "htdocs" and "common" appear in
	this directory hierarchy to contain HTML and non-HTML documents,
	repectively, which are shared by multiple dictionaries or entries.
