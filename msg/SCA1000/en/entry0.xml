following the procedures described in the Sun Crypto Accelerator 1000 Board
User&#39;s Guide.
&lt;p&gt;
If &quot;dca/x&quot; does not exist or SUNVTS diagnostic tests fail,
follow the procedures described in the Sun Crypto Accelerator 1000
Board User&#39;s Guide to replace the board or schedule a repair
procedure to replace it.</item>
