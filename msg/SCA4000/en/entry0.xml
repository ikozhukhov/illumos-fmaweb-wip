	<item>Sun Crypto Accelerator 4000 Hardware May Be Faulty</item>

	<name>description</name>
	<item>The %DISTRO% Fault Manager has determined that a hardware
fault was detected on Sun Crypto Accelerator 4000 card which requires
repair action.</item>

	<name>response</name>
	<item>The driver has been disabled and unregistered as a hardware
provider to the %DISTRO% Cryptographic Framework.</item>

	<name>impact</name>
	<item>The card will no longer function as a network device or
cryptographic accelerator until the problem has been resolved.</item>

	<name>action</name>
	<item>Run the SCA4000 diagnostic tests for the
adapter (rsrc) identified in the fmdump(1M) output as instructed in the Sun
Crypto Accelerator 4000 Board Installation and Users Guide.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If diagnostic tests fail, perform a keystore backup and schedule a
repair procedure to replace the affected adapter.

The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
indicates diagnosis has determined
that a SCA4000 PCI adapter is faulty.  The SCA4000 (vca) driver
has disabled the network and cryptographic accelerator
interfaces.  Before replacing the adapter, diagnostic tests should
be run to verify its health.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If diagnostic tests are successful, the network and cryptographic
accelerator interfaces may be brought back into service using the
fmadm(1M) command:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;fmadm repair &amp;lt;EVENT-ID&amp;gt;
