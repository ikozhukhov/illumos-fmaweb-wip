	<item>Sun Crypto Accelerator 4000 Firmware May Be Defective</item>

	<name>description</name>
	<item>The Solaris Fault Manager has determined that a firmware
defect was detected on Sun Crypto Accelerator 4000 card which requires
repair action.</item>

	<name>response</name>
	<item>The driver has been disabled and unregistered as a hardware
provider to the Solaris Cryptographic Framework.</item>

	<name>impact</name>
	<item>The card will no longer function as a network device or
cryptographic accelerator until the problem has been resolved.</item>

	<name>action</name>
	<item>Run &lt;tt&gt;pkgchk -n SUNWvcafw&lt;/tt&gt; to ensure that the latest firmware
package is correctly installed and has been downloaded to the adapter
(rsrc) identified in the fmdump(1M) output as instructed in the Sun
Crypto Accelerator 4000 Board Installation and Users Guide.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If the latest firmware has already been correctly installed, contact
Sun for support.</item>

	<item>The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
indicates diagnosis has determined
that the firmware running on the SCA4000 PCI adapter is
defective.  The SCA4000 (vca) driver
has disabled the network and cryptographic accelerator
interfaces.  Insure that the latest firmware package
(SUNWvcafw) is installed on the system and that the firmware supplied
with that package (sca4000fw) has been downloaded to the card before
contacting Sun for support.  The version 2.0 driver will only
work with firmware version 2.0 or higher.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Refer to the Sun Crypto Accelerator 4000 Board Installation and Users
Guide for information on determining version of firmware currently
running on the card and downloading the correct version if necessary.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After installing the latest firmware version, the network and
cryptographic
accelerator interfaces may be brought back into service using the
fmadm(1M) command:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
fmadm repair &amp;lt;EVENT-ID&amp;gt;</item>
