	<item>Sun Crypto Accelerator 4000 Driver May Be Defective</item>

	<name>description</name>
	<item>The Solaris Fault Manager has determined that a software
defect was detected in Sun Crypto Accelerator 4000 driver which
requires repair action.</item>

	<name>response</name>
	<item>The driver has been disabled and unregistered as a hardware
provider to the Solaris Cryptographic Framework.</item>

	<name>impact</name>
	<item>The card will no longer function as a network device or
cryptographic accelerator until the problem has been resolved.</item>

	<name>action</name>
	<item>Run &lt;tt&gt;pkgchk -n SUNWvcar&lt;/tt&gt; to ensure that the latest software
is correctly installed on the system for the module
(rsrc) identified in the fmdump(1M) output as instructed in the Sun Crypto
Accelerator 4000 Board Installation and Users Guide.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If the latest driver has already been installed, contact
Sun for support.</item>

The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
indicates diagnosis has determined
that the SCA4000 (vca) driver is
defective.  The SCA4000 (vca) driver
has disabled the network and cryptographic accelerator
interfaces.  Insure that the latest driver package
(SUNWvcar) is installed on the system.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After installing the latest software,&amp;nbsp; the network and
cryptographic
accelerator interfaces may be brought back into service using the
fmadm(1M) command:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;fmadm repair &amp;lt;event_id&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
