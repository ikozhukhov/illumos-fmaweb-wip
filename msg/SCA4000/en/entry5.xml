	<item>Sun Crypto Accelerator 4000 Unable To Load Keystore</item>

	<name>description</name>
	<item>The %DISTRO% Fault Manager has determined that there is a
problem loading the keystore to the Sun Crypto Accelerator 4000 via the
vcad daemon which requires repair action.</item>

	<name>response</name>
	<item>The driver will attempt to load the keystore prior to
performing every cryptographic operation until the file is successfully
loaded.</item>

	<name>impact</name>
	<item>The card will continue to function, but will be unable to
perform cryptographic operations using secure keys until the keystore
file can be loaded.</item>

	<name>action</name>
	<item>Restore the keystore file to the correct location for the
module (rsrc) identified in the fmdump(1M) output.  Refer to the
Sun Crypto Accelerator 4000 Board Installation and Users Guide for
information on restoring the missing or corrupt keystore.</item>

The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
indicates diagnosis has determined
that the SCA4000 (vca) driver was unable to load the keystore via the
vcad daemon.  The keystore file is most likely missing or corrupt
and should be restored to the correct location.  If the keystore
file is not longer available, the card must be zeroized and
re-initialized with a new keystore.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After restoring the missing or corrupt keystore, the network and
cryptographic
accelerator interfaces may be brought back into service using the
fmadm(1M) command:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
fmadm repair &amp;lt;EVENT-ID&amp;gt;
