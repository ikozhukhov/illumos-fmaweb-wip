	<item>A serious overvoltage failure has occurred on a device or FRU.

The FRU or device with the overvoltage failure
can be identified from the FMRI of the fault report.

The following section provides a list of the potential FRUs and devices
that can encounter an overvoltage failure, and specifies the impact and
automated actions taken by the platform or domain in response to the fault.

 

   SPARC Enterprise M3000 platforms:


      DDC on a Motherboard:

         Platform is powered off and cannot be powered back up.
         Platform is unbootable.


The recommended service action for this event is to schedule the replacement of the affected FRU.


Step 1. Collect the Fault Message  (two methods)


   Single-line fault message displayed on the XSCF console:

   Mar 27 15:19:33 nwk-ik-1-0 fmd: SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.12, CSN: BF00000031
   EVENT-ID: 316abc6f-4635-4c4a-880a-a9b646c79cc8
   Refer to http://www.sun.com/msg/SCF-8004-PS for detailed information.


   Complete fault message using &#39;fmdump -m&#39; on the XSCF console:

   MSG-ID: SCF-8004-PS, TYPE: Fault, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Critical
   EVENT-TIME: Tue Jun 10 03:51:09 PDT 2008
   PLATFORM: SPARC Enterprise M3000, CSN: BF00000031, HOSTNAME: san-ik-13-0
   SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.16
   EVENT-ID: 3df526f5-f743-4ee1-b237-13b945a357dc
   DESC: A serious overvoltage failure has occurred on a device or FRU.
   Refer to http://www.sun.com/msg/SCF-8004-PS for more information.
   AUTO-RESPONSE: The device or FRU will be deconfigured.
   IMPACT: Domains may be reset, platform may become unbootable, or the platform may be powered down.
   REC-ACTION: Schedule a repair action to replace the affected Field Replaceable Unit (FRU),
   the identity of which can be determined using fmdump -v -u EVENT_ID.
   Please consult the detail section of the knowledge article for additional information.


Step 2. Collect the output from the &#39;fmdump  -v  -u  Event-ID&#39; command
 


   SPARC Enterprise platform example:

   xscf&gt; fmdump -v -u 3df526f5-f743-4ee1-b237-13b945a357dc
