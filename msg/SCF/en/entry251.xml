	<item>The XSCF could not determine whether POST is running correctly on a
domain/XSB.

The domain or the XSB will be powered down. If this fault did not occur during a DR operation,
the XSB will be deconfigured.

The recommended service action for this event is to schedule the replacement of the affected FRU.

Step 1. Collect the fault message (use one of the following methods):


   Single-line fault message displayed on the XSCF console:

   Dec 12 12:26:32 san-ff2-16-0 fmd: SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.15, CSN: BE80601000
   EVENT-ID: 8b5cfa23-0219-493c-aaed-64d785d3b793
   Refer to %FMAURL%/SCF-8007-UQ for detailed information.

   Complete fault message using &#39;fmdump -m&#39; on the XSCF console:

   MSG-ID: SCF-8007-UQ, TYPE: Fault, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Critical
   EVENT-TIME: Wed Dec 12 12:26:32 PST 2007
   PLATFORM: SPARC Enterprise M5000, CSN: BE80601000, HOSTNAME: san-ff2-16-0
   SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.15
   EVENT-ID: 8b5cfa23-0219-493c-aaed-64d785d3b793
   DESC: The XSCF could not determine whether POST is running correctly on a domain/XSB.
   Refer to %FMAURL%/SCF-8007-UQ for more information.
   AUTO-RESPONSE: If the event occurred during POST at domain startup, the domain is powered
   down. If the event occurred during POST at the time of a DR operation, the XSB
   being DR&#39;ed is powered down.  No other action is taken.
   IMPACT: The domain or the XSB will be powered down.
   REC-ACTION: Schedule a repair action to replace the affected Field Replaceable Unit (FRU),
   the identity of which can be determined using fmdump -v -u EVENT_ID.
   Please consult the detail section of the knowledge article for additional information.


Step 2. Collect the output from the &#39;fmdump -v -u EVENT_ID&#39; command

 xscf&gt; fmdump -v -u 8b5cfa23-0219-493c-aaed-64d785d3b793

        TIME                 UUID                                 MSG-ID
        Dec 12 12:26:32.7882 8b5cfa23-0219-493c-aaed-64d785d3b793 SCF-8007-UQ
        100%  fault.chassis.domain.post

              Problem in: hc:///chassis=0/cmu=0/xsb=0
                 Affects: hc:///chassis=0/cmu=0/xsb=0
                     FRU: hc://:product-id=SPARC Enterprise M5000:chassis-id=BE80601000:
                          server-id=san-ff2-16-0:
                          part=CA20393-B50X 001AA:revision=0101/component=/MBU_B
                Location: /MBU_B


Step 3. Contact your Authorized Service Provider.
