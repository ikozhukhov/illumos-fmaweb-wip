The system administrator should:


    Examine output displayed to the XSCF console and XSCF logs files to identify if a fault had occurred;

	XSCF&gt; fmdump -m
	XSCF&gt; fmdump -v



If the problem persists, proceed with the steps outlined below.



Step 1. Collect the fault message (use one of the following methods):


   Single-line fault message displayed on the XSCF console:

   Refer to http://www.sun.com/msg/SCF-8008-27 for detailed information.


   Complete fault message using &#39;fmdump -m&#39; on the XSCF console:
