	<item>This message indicates a hard-to-diagnose problem was detected while running OpenBoot PROM.

Nothing is deconfigured.

The system administrator should:

   Make sure OpenBoot PROM variables are set correctly.

   Examine output displayed to the XSCF console and XSCF logs files
   to identify if a fault had occurred;

       XSCF&gt; fmdump -m
       XSCF&gt; fmdump -v


If the problem persists, proceed with the steps outlined below.

Step 1. Collect the fault message (use one of the following methods):

   Single-line fault message displayed on the XSCF console:

   Dec 12 12:27:23 san-ff2-16-0 fmd: SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.15, CSN: BE80601000
   EVENT-ID: 3c236f3a-7ec0-4fad-94ec-a4195c1a0abc
   Refer to %FMAURL%/SCF-8008-3U for detailed information.


   Complete fault message using &#39;fmdump -m&#39; on the XSCF console:

   MSG-ID: SCF-8008-3U, TYPE: upset, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Critical
   EVENT-TIME: Wed Dec 12 12:27:23 PST 2007
   PLATFORM: SPARC Enterprise M5000, CSN: BE80601000, HOSTNAME: san-ff2-16-0
   SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.15
   EVENT-ID: 3c236f3a-7ec0-4fad-94ec-a4195c1a0abc
   DESC: A hard-to-diagnose problem was detected by OpenBoot PROM.
   Refer to %FMAURL%/SCF-8008-3U for more information.
   AUTO-RESPONSE: Nothing is deconfigured. Please consult the detail section of the knowledge article
   for additional information.
   IMPACT: System may drop to the &#39;OK&#39; prompt.
   REC-ACTION: The platform administrator should check to see if any other hardware failure has occurred
   on the platform. The platform administrator should check to make sure OBP environment variables
   have been set correctly. If neither of these courses of action provide a resolution, then the
   platform administrator should schedule a service action.



Step 2. Collect the output from the &#39;fmdump -v -u EVENT_ID&#39; command


   SPARC Enterprise platform example:

   xscf&gt; fmdump -v -u 3c236f3a-7ec0-4fad-94ec-a4195c1a0abc

	TIME                 UUID                                 MSG-ID
