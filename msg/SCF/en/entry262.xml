The platform powers up normally.

    SPARC Enterprise M4000/M5000 platforms:

       If the XSCFU fails while the Operator Panel is missing, then the XSCFU configuration
       information will be lost.

    SPARC Enterprise M8000/M9000 platforms:

       If the XSCFU and the standby XSCFU both fail while the Operator Panel is missing, then
       the XSCFU configuration information will be lost.

The recommended service action for this event is to schedule the replacement of the Operator Panel.
