If there are sufficient operational XBUs on the platform, the platform will be powered up
and the platform will operate with reduced performance. If there are insufficient operational
XBUs on the platform, the entire platform will not be powered up and the platform becomes unbootable.

The recommended service action for this event is to schedule the replacement of the XBU.


Step 1. Collect the Fault Message  (two methods)


   Single-line fault message displayed on the XSCF console:

   Dec 13 06:08:31 san-dc3-2-0 fmd: SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.15, CSN: 2010643002
   EVENT-ID: cf5ac11c-fc13-4462-9bcf-8272f85c4198
   Refer to http://www.sun.com/msg/SCF-8008-8T for detailed information.


   Complete fault message using &#39;fmdump -m&#39; on the XSCF console:

   MSG-ID: SCF-8008-8T, TYPE: upset, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Critical
   EVENT-TIME: Thu Dec 13 06:08:31 PST 2007
   PLATFORM: SPARC Enterprise M9000, CSN: 2010643002, HOSTNAME: san-dc3-2-0
   SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.15
   EVENT-ID: cf5ac11c-fc13-4462-9bcf-8272f85c4198
   DESC: An XBU is either not present or could not be detected during powerup.
   Refer to http://www.sun.com/msg/SCF-8008-8T for more information.
   AUTO-RESPONSE: If there are insufficient operational XBUs on the platform, the entire platform will not be
   powered up and the platform becomes unbootable. Please consult the detail section of the knowledge
   article for additional information.
   IMPACT: If there are sufficient operational XBUs on the platform, the platform will be powered up
   and the platform will operate with reduced performance. If there are insufficient operational
   XBUs on the platform, the entire platform will not be powered up and the platform becomes unbootable.
   Please consult the detail section of the knowledge article for additional information.
   REC-ACTION: Schedule a repair action to replace the XBU.



Step 2. Collect the output from the &#39;fmdump  -v  -u  Event-ID&#39; command


   SPARC Enterprise platform example:

   xscf&gt; fmdump -v -u cf5ac11c-fc13-4462-9bcf-8272f85c4198
