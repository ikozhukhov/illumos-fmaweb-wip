If there are sufficient operational CLKUs on the platform, the platform will be powered up.
If there are insufficient operational CLKUs on the platform, the entire platform will not be

The recommended service action for this event is to schedule the replacement of the CLKU.


Step 1. Collect the Fault Message  (two methods)


   Single-line fault message displayed on the XSCF console:

   EVENT-ID: 5dafd588-5d3b-4e98-a10b-d628d7aa8e17
   Refer to %FMAURL%/SCF-8008-96 for detailed information.


   Complete fault message using &#39;fmdump -m&#39; on the XSCF console:

Step 2. Collect the output from the &#39;fmdump  -v  -u  Event-ID&#39; command


   SPARC Enterprise platform example:

   xscf&gt; fmdump -v -u 5dafd588-5d3b-4e98-a10b-d628d7aa8e17
