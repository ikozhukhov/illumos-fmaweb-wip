Step 1. Collect the fault message (use one of the following methods):

   Single-line fault message displayed on the XSCF console:

   EVENT-ID: ba1f856d-e6de-4d65-83db-dc9c15025883
   Refer to %FMAURL%/SCF-8001-CP  for detailed information.

   Complete fault message using &#39;fmdump -m&#39; on the XSCF console:

   MSG-ID:  SCF-8001-CP , TYPE: Fault, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Major    
   EVENT-TIME: Thu Apr 12 16:47:17 PDT 2007    
   PLATFORM: SPARC-Enterprise, CSN: BE80601000, HOSTNAME: san-ik-1-0    
   SOURCE: sde, REV: 1.12    
   EVENT-ID: ba1f856d-e6de-4d65-83db-dc9c15025883 
   DESC: A non-fatal uncorrectable error occurred due to an on-board Gigabit 
   Ethernet controller.
   Refer to %FMAURL%/SCF-8001-CP for more information.    
   AUTO-RESPONSE: No immediate action is taken. Please consult the detail section of the
   knowledge article for additional information.
   IMPACT: The non-fatal error may cause the domain to panic.
   REC-ACTION: Schedule a repair action to replace the affected Field Replaceable Unit (FRU),
   the identity of which can be determined using fmdump -v -u EVENT_ID.
   Please consult the detail section of the knowledge article for additional information.


Step 2. Collect the output from the &#39;fmdump -v -u EVENT_ID&#39; command
   

   SPARC Enterprise platform example:
 
   xscf&gt; fmdump -v -u ba1f856d-e6de-4d65-83db-dc9c15025883

         TIME                 UUID                                 MSG-ID

           100%  fault.chassis.SPARC-Enterprise.io.pci.gbe.se                   

                 Problem in: hc:///chassis=0/iou=0/ioc=0/ch=0/leaf=0/gbe=1                     
                    Affects: -                         
                        FRU: hc://:product-id=SPARC-Enterprise:chassis-id=BE80601000:
                             server-id=san-ik-1-0/component=/MBUA
