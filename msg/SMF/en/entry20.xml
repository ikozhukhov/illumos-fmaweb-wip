	<item>The %DISTRO% Repository Daemon discovered that the smf(5)
repository is corrupt.</item>
	<name>details</name>
	<item>When &lt;code&gt;svc.configd&lt;/code&gt;(1M), the %DISTRO% Repository Daemon,
	  is started, it does an integrity check of the &lt;code&gt;smf&lt;/code&gt;(5)
	  repository, stored in &lt;code&gt;/etc/svc/repository.db&lt;/code&gt;.  This
	  integrity check can fail due to a disk failure, the database
	  file being corrupted either due to a hardware bug, a software
	  bug, or an accidental overwrite.  If the integrity check fails,
	  &lt;code&gt;svc.configd&lt;/code&gt; will write a message to the console, similar
	  to the following:
	  &lt;pre&gt;
svc.configd: smf(5) database integrity check of:

    /etc/svc/repository.db

  failed.  The database might be damaged or a media error might have
  prevented it from being verified.  Additional information useful to
  your service provider is in:

    /etc/svc/volatile/db_errors

  The system will not be able to boot until you have restored a working
  database.  svc.startd(1M) will provide a sulogin(1M) prompt for recovery
  purposes.  The command:

    /lib/svc/bin/restore_repository

  can be run to restore a backup version of your repository.  See
  %FMAURL%/SMF-8000-MY for more information.
	  &lt;/pre&gt;
	  and exit, informing &lt;code&gt;svc.startd&lt;/code&gt;(1M) that system
	  maintenance is needed.  &lt;code&gt;svc.startd&lt;/code&gt;(1M) will then
	  starts &lt;code&gt;sulogin&lt;/code&gt;(1M), allowing the system
	  administrator to perform maintenance.
	&lt;p&gt;
	  Once the system administrator has logged in, he should
	  run &lt;code&gt;/lib/svc/bin/restore_repository&lt;/code&gt;, which will
	  take him through the steps necessary to restore a non-corrupt
	  backup.  &lt;code&gt;smf&lt;/code&gt;(5) automatically takes backups of the
	  repository at key system moments:
	  &lt;ul&gt;
	    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;boot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; backup is taken immediately
	    before the first change to the repository is made during each
	    system startup.
	    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;manifest_import&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; backup is taken
	    after &lt;code&gt;svc:/system/manifest-import:default&lt;/code&gt;
	    completes, if it imported any new manifests or ran any upgrade
	    scripts.
	  &lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
	  The system maintains up to four backups of each type, deleting
	  the oldest backup when necessary.  The backups are stored as
&lt;code&gt;/etc/svc/repository-&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;YYYYMMDD&lt;/i&gt;_&lt;i&gt;HHMMSS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,
	  where &lt;code&gt;YYYYMMDD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;HHMMSS&lt;/code&gt; are the date
	  (year, month, day) and time (24-hour hour, minute, second),
	  when the backup was taken.
	&lt;p&gt;
	  When started, &lt;code&gt;/lib/svc/bin/restore_repository&lt;/code&gt;
	  prints out a message similar to the following:
	  &lt;pre&gt;
Repository Restore utility

See %FMAURL%/SMF-8000-MY for more information on the use of
this script to restore backup copies of the smf(5) repository.

If there are any problems which need human intervention, this script will
give instructions and then exit back to your shell.

Note that upon full completion of this script, the system will be rebooted
using reboot(1M), which will interrupt any active services.
	  &lt;/pre&gt;
	  If the system being recovered is not a local zone (see
	  &lt;code&gt;zones&lt;/code&gt;(5)), the script will give you instructions
	  on how to re-mount &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/usr&lt;/code&gt;
	  read-write, so that it can recover the databases.  After
	  printing the instructions, the script will exit.
	  The administrator should follow the directions given, paying
	  careful attention to any errors which may occur.
	&lt;p&gt;
	  After &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; has been mounted writable (or if the
	  system is a local zone), &lt;code&gt;restore_repository&lt;/code&gt; will
	  prompt you for the repository backup you would like to
	  restore, with a message similar to:
	  &lt;pre&gt;
The following backups of /etc/svc/repository.db exists, from
oldest to newest:

&lt;i&gt;... list of backups ...&lt;/i&gt;

The backups are named based on their type and the time when they were taken.
Backups beginning with &quot;boot&quot; are made before the first change is made to
the repository after system boot.  Backups beginning with &quot;manifest_import&quot;
are made after svc:/system/manifest-import:default finishes its processing.
The time of backup is given in YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS format.

Please enter one of:
        1) boot, for the most recent post-boot backup
        2) manifest_import, for the most recent manifest_import backup.
        3) a specific backup repository from the above list
        4) -seed-, the initial starting repository.  (All customizations
           will be lost.)
        5) -quit-, to cancel.

Enter response [boot]: 
	  &lt;/pre&gt;
	  If you type &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt; without specifying a backup to
	  restore, the default response, enclosed in &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;
	  will be chosen.   Entering &lt;code&gt;-quit-&lt;/code&gt; will exit the
	  &lt;code&gt;restore_repository&lt;/code&gt; shell, returning you to the
	  &lt;code&gt;sulogin&lt;/code&gt;(1M) prompt.  Entering &lt;code&gt;-seed-&lt;/code&gt;
	  will restore the &quot;seed&quot; repository, which is designed for use
	  during initial installation and upgrade -- using it as a recovery
	  repository should be a last resort, since it is not designed
	  for that use.
	&lt;p&gt;
	  Typically, the most recent backup should be chosen.
	&lt;p&gt;
	  Once the backup to restore has been selected, it is validated
	  and integrity checked.  If there are any problems,
	  &lt;code&gt;restore_repository&lt;/code&gt; will print error messages and
	  prompt for another selection.  Once a valid backup has been
	  selected, &lt;code&gt;restore_repository&lt;/code&gt; will print out the
	  steps it is going to take, and prompt for final confirmation:
	  &lt;pre&gt;
After confirmation, the following steps will be taken:

svc.startd(1M) and svc.configd(1M) will be quiesced, if running.
/etc/svc/repository.db
    -- renamed --&amp;gt; /etc/svc/repository.db_old_&lt;i&gt;YYYYMMDD&lt;/i&gt;_&lt;i&gt;HHMMSS&lt;/i&gt;
/etc/svc/volatile/db_errors
    -- copied --&amp;gt; /etc/svc/repository.db_old_&lt;i&gt;YYYYMMDD&lt;/i&gt;_&lt;i&gt;HHMMSS&lt;/i&gt;_errors
&lt;i&gt;repository_to_restore&lt;/i&gt;
    -- copied --&amp;gt; /etc/svc/repository.db
and the system will be rebooted with reboot(1M).

Proceed [yes/no]? 
	   &lt;/pre&gt;
	   Typing &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt; will cause the actions listed to be
	   carried out, including making the system reboot, remedying the
	   fault. See the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-1985/ecdps?a=view&quot;/&gt;
