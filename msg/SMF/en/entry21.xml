Wait for a moment in case the responsible restarter is still processing
commands.  If the condition persists, try refreshing or disabling and
enabling the service with svcadm(1M).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If the service remains in the invalid state, this error suggests a
defect in the responsible restarter, the configuration repository
daemon, or the temporary repository contents. Contact Sun Service with
the output of svcs -x, svcs -l restarter_service_fmri, a core file of
the restarter, a core file of svc.configd(1M), and a copy of
/etc/svc/volatile/svc_nonpersist.db. A core file can be generated by the
gcore(1) utility.

The Solaris Service Manager issues commands for a service to its
responsible restarter, which may be the Solaris Service Manager itself.
In the course of operations, the the responsible restarter updates the
service&#39;s state in the non-persistent portion of the repository.  If a
component failure results in the state update being incorrect, then
subsequent operations may fail and require administrative interaction.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Message ID:   SMF-8000-N3 indicates that the service&#39;s state is
invalid.
&lt;/p&gt;
