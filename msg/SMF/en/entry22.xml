Wait until the service reaches the declared next state, or definitively fails
to do so. (If the service&#39;s executing method executes for longer than its
associated timeout, then the restarter will declare the method to have
failed.)  The next state may be viewed by invoking &quot;svcs -v&quot;.

	<item>&lt;p&gt;
If a service is being moved to a state (due to an administrative action
or a response to a failure of that service or a dependency), the %DISTRO%
Service Manager will ultimately send a request to the service&#39;s restarter. If
the service&#39;s restarter is the %DISTRO% Service Manager
(svc:/system/svc/restarter:default), it will execute the service&#39;s
appropriate method to complete the transition. For most services, when
the method completes successfully, the service will be placed in the
requested state.
&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;
The Message ID:   SMF-8000-PH indicates that the transition 
is in progress. This outcome can indicate a system being shut down,
or a defect in %DISTRO% or third party software.
&lt;/p&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;
If the service does not leave the initial state, contact Sun Service
with the output of svcs -x and svcs -l service_fmri.
