	<item>Service's method has failed repeatedly</item>

	<name>description</name>
	<item>The %DISTRO% Service Manager has determined that the service has been moved into maintenance because one of its methods (other than the start method) has failed repeatedly.</item>

	<name>impact</name>
	<item>The service will remain in the maintenance state until the condition that led to method failure is remedied, and the service's maintenance state is cleared by the administrator.  Services that express a dependency on the impacted services may also be affected.</item>

	<name>action</name>
	<item>The per-instance log file may contain information to determine the cause of method failure.  Log files associated with the service are typically in &lt;code&gt;/var/svc/log&lt;/code&gt; and are named based on the service instance's FMRI.  (Services that start very early in boot may log instead to	&lt;code&gt;/etc/svc/volatile&lt;/code&gt;.)  A review of the service's configuration files may also be appropriate.  &lt;p&gt; Once remedied, run &lt;code&gt;svcadm&amp;nbsp;clear&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;impacted_service_fmri&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to bring the service instance out of the maintenance state.	&lt;/p&gt;</item>
