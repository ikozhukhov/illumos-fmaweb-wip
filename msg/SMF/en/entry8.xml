	<item>Service's method failed</item>

	<name>description</name>
	<item>The service's restarter tried to execute a method for the service, but it did not complete successfully.</item>

	<name>impact</name>
	<item>The service may or may not be running.  It will not be started until the maintenance state is cleared.  Services with require-type dependencies on the service will not be started.  (Use &lt;code&gt;svcs&amp;nbsp;-xv &lt;i&gt;service_fmri&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to see a list of services waiting for the service to start.)</item>

	<name>action</name>
	<item>&lt;p&gt;Determine what method failed and why.  Consult the service's log file, typically in &lt;code&gt;/var/svc/log&lt;/code&gt; and named based on the service's FMRI.  (Very early in boot, service logs are placed in &lt;code&gt;/etc/svc/volatile&lt;/code&gt;.)  If the stop method failed, processes which belonged to the service may still be running.&lt;p&gt;Once the problem has been fixed, run &lt;code&gt;svcadm&amp;nbsp;clear &lt;i&gt;service_fmri&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to request that the Solaris Service Manager clear the maintenance state and treat the service normally.  If it is enabled and its dependencies are met, it will be started.</item>
