While a service is disabled, the %DISTRO% Service Manager will not
start it.  If a running service is disabled (for example, by
<code>svcadm&nbsp;disable&nbsp;-t</code>),
the Service Manager will send a stop command to the service's
restarter, which may be the %DISTRO% Service Manager itself.  The
restarter will stop the service and place it in the disabled state.
<p>
The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-05</b></code></font> indicates
that the service is disabled.

If the Suggested Action fails to start the service, contact Sun Service
with the output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-xv</code>,<code> svcs&nbsp;-l&nbsp;</code> and
the output from <i>/var/svc/log/</i> from associated service. See <code>smf(5)</code>
for additional FMRI definition.
