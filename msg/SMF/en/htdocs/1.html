While a service is disabled, the Solaris Service Manager will not
start it.  If a running service is disabled (for example, by
<code>svcadm disable -t <i>service_fmri</i></code>), the
Service Manager will send a stop command to the service's restarter,
which may be the Solaris Service Manager itself.  The restarter will
stop the service and place it in the disabled state.  Temporary
disable does not persist past system shutdown.
<p>
The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-1S</b></code></font> indicates that the
service is temporarily disabled.
</p>
<p>
If the Suggested Action fails to start the service, contact Sun Service with the output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and <code>svcs&nbsp;-l&nbsp;<i>service_fmri</i></code>.
