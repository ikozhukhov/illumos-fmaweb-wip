	<p>
	  When a restarter places a service into an unusual state, it may
	  supply an explanation.
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
	  size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-AR</b></code></font> indicates
	that the restarter supplied an unknown explanation.  If
	<code>svc:/system/svc/restarter:default</code> is the
	restarter, this condition generally indicates a defect in
	%DISTRO%.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If the service cannot be started, contact Sun Service with the
	  output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and <code>svcs&nbsp;-l
	  <i>service_fmri</i></code>.
	</p>
