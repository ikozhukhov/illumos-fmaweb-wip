	<p>
	  Determine the restarter for the service with <code>svcs&nbsp;-l
	  <i>service_fmri</i></code>.

	<p>
	  For services managed by
	  <code>svc:/system/svc/restarter:default</code>, collect
	data for Sun Service.  In particular, obtain a core file for
	<code>svc.startd</code>(1M) by using <code>gcore</code>(1), as
	well as <code>svcs -x</code> output.  Once data has been
	obtained, it may be possible to restore service operation by
	requesting restart or clearing a degraded or maintenance state,
	using <code>svcadm</code>(1M).
	<p>
	For services managed by other restarters, no diagnosis may be
	available by design.  See the documentation for the relevant
	restarter for guidance.
	If the service is in the maintenance state, <code>svcadm&nbsp;clear
	<i>service_fmri</i></code> will instruct the restarter to clear it.
	</p>
