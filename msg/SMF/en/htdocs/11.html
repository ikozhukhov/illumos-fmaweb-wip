	<p>
	  If a service is enabled and its dependencies are met, the %DISTRO%
	  Service Manager will send a start command to the service's
	  restarter.
	  If the service's restarter is the %DISTRO% Service Manager
	  (<code>svc:/system/svc/restarter:default</code>), it will execute
	  the service's start method.
	  For most services, when the method completes successfully, the
	  service will be placed in the online state.

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
	  size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-C4</b></code></font> indicates
        that the transition from offline to online is in progress.
	This outcome can indicate a booting or restarting system, or
	a defect in %DISTRO% or third
	party software. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  If the service does not leave the offline state, contact Sun
	  Service with the output of
	<code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and
	<code>svcs&nbsp;-l <i>service_fmri</i></code>.
