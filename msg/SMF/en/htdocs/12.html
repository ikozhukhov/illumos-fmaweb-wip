	  The restarter for a service may determine that the service is
	  operational, but not at full capacity.
	  When it does so, it places the service in the degraded state.

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
	  size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-DX</b></code></font> indicates
	that the administrator has requested that the service be marked as
	degraded.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If running <code>svcadm&nbsp;clear&nbsp;<i>service_fmri</i></code> fails to clear the degraded state, contact Sun Service with the output of
	<code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and
	<code>svcs&nbsp;-l <i>service_fmri</i></code>.
