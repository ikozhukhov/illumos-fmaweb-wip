	<p>
	  If a service is enabled and its dependencies are met, the Solaris
	  Service Manager will send a start command to the service's
	  restarter, which may be the Solaris Service Manager itself.
	  Require-type dependencies are only considered satisfied when the
	  indicated services are running (online or degraded).

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<font size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-E2</b></code></font>
	indicates that the service has a require-type dependency on
	a service which does not exist.  Under such circumstances, the
	Service Manager will not attempt to start it.
	</p>
	<p>
	This outcome can indicate a misunderstanding of the requirements
	of various software components, a misconfiguration of the system,
	or a defect in Solaris.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If the service remains offline, contact Sun Service with the
	output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and <code>svcs&nbsp;-l
	<i>service_fmri</i></code>.
	</p>

	See <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/selfheal/">"Predictive
	Self-Healing"</a> for additional information.
