	<p>
	  If a service is enabled and its dependencies are met, the Solaris
	  Service Manager will send a start command to the service's
	  restarter, which may be the Solaris Service Manager itself.
	  Exclude-type dependencies are only met when the indicated services
	  are not running.

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<font size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-FJ</b></code></font> indicates
	that the service has an exclude-type dependency on a service
	which is running.
	This outcome can indicate a partially completed administrative change,
	a misunderstanding of the requirements of various software
	components, a misconfiguration of the system, or a defect in
	Solaris. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  If the service cannot be started, contact Sun Service with the
	  output of
	<code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and <code>svcs&nbsp;-l
	<i>service_fmri</i></code>.
	</p>

	<p>
	See <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/selfheal/">"Predictive
	Self-Healing"</a> for additional information.
