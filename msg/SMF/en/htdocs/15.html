	<p>
	  If a service is enabled and its dependencies are met, the
	  %DISTRO% Service Manager will send a start command to the
	  service's restarter, which may be the %DISTRO% Service Manager
	  itself.
	  Dependencies other than exclude-type dependencies are satisfied
	  when the indicated services are running (online or degraded
	  states).

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<font size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-GE</b></code></font>
	indicates that the %DISTRO% Service Manager determined that the
	service's dependencies are not met.
	This outcome can indicate a misunderstanding of the requirements
	of various software components, a misconfiguration of the system,
	or a defect in %DISTRO%.
	</p>


	<p>
	See <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/selfheal/">"Predictive
	Self-Healing"</a> for additional information and the
        <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/howtoguides/servicemgmthowto.jsp#1/">
        "SMF How To Guide"</a> to clear dependencies.
        </p>

        <p>
        If the service does not start, contact Sun Service with the
	output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-xv</code>, <code>svcs&nbsp;-l
	</i></code>, and <code>/var/svc/log</code> for associated service.
        See <code>svcs(1)</code> for additional syntax.
