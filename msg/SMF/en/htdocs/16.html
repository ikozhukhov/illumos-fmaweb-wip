	<p>
	  The Solaris Service Manager uses the dependencies of a service
	  to determine when the service should be started.
	  Dependencies which form a cycle are considered invalid.
	  The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
	  size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-HP</b></code></font> indicates
	  that the Solaris Service Manager placed the service into
	  maintenance for this reason.
	This outcome can indicate a misunderstanding of the requirements of
	various software components, a misconfiguration of the system,
	or a defect in Solaris.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If the service cannot be restored, contact Sun Service with the
	output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code>, the relevant log messages from
	<code>/var/adm/messages</code>, and, for each service in the
	dependency cycle, output from <code>svcs&nbsp;-l
	<i>service_fmri</i></code>.
	</p>

	<p>
	See <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/selfheal/">"Predictive
	Self-Healing"</a> for additional information.
