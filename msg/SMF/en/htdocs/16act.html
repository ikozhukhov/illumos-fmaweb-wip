	<p>
	  Determine the dependency chain which leads to the service.
	  The %DISTRO% Service Manager logged the FMRIs of the services
	  to <code>/var/adm/messages</code> under standard
	  <code>syslogd</code>(1M) settings.
	  Direct dependencies of the service may be listed with
	  <code>svcs&nbsp;-l <i>service_fmri</i></code>.

	<p>
	  Depending on
	administrator understanding of the impacted service, it may be
	preferable to attempt repair or removal of the dependency using
	<code>svccfg</code>(1M) or to consult with Sun Service.

	<p>
	  Once the dependency chain has been broken,
	  <code>svcadm&nbsp;refresh <i>service_fmri</i></code> will instruct
	  the Service Manager to reread the service's dependencies, and
	  <code>svcadm&nbsp;clear <i>service_fmri</i></code> will instruct
	  the Service Manager to clear the service's maintenance state.
