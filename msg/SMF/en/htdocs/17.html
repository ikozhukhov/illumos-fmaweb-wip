	<p>
	  The Solaris Service Manager uses the dependencies of a service to
	  decide when to start it.
	  Dependencies are read from the from the running snapshot of
	  a service's configuration.

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
	  size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-JA</b></code></font> indicates
	that the Solaris Service Manager has determined that the
	service's dependency configuration is invalid and placed the service
	into the maintenance state.
	This outcome can indicate a misunderstanding of the requirements of
	various software components, a misconfiguration of the system,
	or a defect in Solaris or third party software.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If the service cannot be corrected, contact
	Sun Service with the output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and
	<code>svcs&nbsp;-l <i>service_fmri</i></code>.
	</p>
