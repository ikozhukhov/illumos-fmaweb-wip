	<p>
	The dependencies of a service may be retrieved using
	<code>svcs&nbsp;-l&nbsp;<i>service_fmri</i></code>.
	Invalid dependencies will be marked.
	Depending on administrator
	understanding of the impacted service, it may be preferable to
	attempt repair or removal of the dependency using
	<code>svccfg</code> or to consult with Sun Service.

	<p>
	  Once the dependency is corrected, <code>svcadm&nbsp;refresh
	  <i>service_fmri</i></code> will update the service's running
	  configuration snapshot, and <code>svcadm&nbsp;clear
	  <i>service_fmri</i></code> will instruct the Service Manager to
	  restore the service to normal operation.
