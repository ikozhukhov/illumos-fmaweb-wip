	<p>
	  If a service is enabled and its dependencies are met, the
	  %DISTRO% Service Manager will send a start command to the
	  service's restarter, which may be the %DISTRO% Service Manager
	  (<code>svc.startd</code>) itself.
	  To start a service, <code>svc.startd</code> executes the service's
	  start method.
	  If the method is a program and it exits with a non-zero exit
	  status or terminates due to a signal, <code>svc.startd</code>
	  considers the method to have failed.
	  If the method exited with an exit status of
	  <code>$SMF_EXIT_ERR_CONFIG</code> (defined in
	  <code>/lib/svc/share/smf_include.sh</code>), the Service Manager
	  concludes that the service is misconfigured and places it in the
	  maintenance state.
	  Otherwise it retries the method a number of times.
	  If the method fails each time, <code>svc.startd</code> stops
	  retrying and places the service in the maintenance state.

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
	  size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-KS</b></code></font> indicates
	that the %DISTRO% Service Manager has placed a service in the
	maintenance state for this reason.  This outcome can indicate a
	misunderstanding of the requirements of various software
	components, a misconfiguration of the system, or a defect in
	%DISTRO%.
