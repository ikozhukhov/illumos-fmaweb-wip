	<p>
	  Determine why the service's start method failed.
	  Consult the service's log file, typically in
	  <code>/var/svc/log</code> and named based on the service's FMRI.
	  (Very early in boot, service logs are placed in
	  <code>/etc/svc/volatile</code>.)

	<p>
	  Once the problem has been fixed, run <code>svcadm&nbsp;clear
	  <i>service_fmri</i></code> to request that the %DISTRO% Service
	  Manager clear the service's maintenance state and treat the
	  service normally.
	  If it is still enabled and its dependencies are met, it will be
	  started.
