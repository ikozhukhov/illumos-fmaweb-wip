	<p>
	While a service is enabled, the Solaris Service Manager will
	restart it if it terminates.
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<font size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-L5</b></code></font> indicates
	that the Solaris Service Manager determined that the service was
	being restarted too often.

	<p>If the service cannot be fixed, contact Sun Service with the
	output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and
	<code>svcs&nbsp;-l&nbsp;<i>service_fmri</i></code>.

	<p>See <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/selfheal/">
