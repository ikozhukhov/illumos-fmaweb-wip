	<p>
	Determine why the service was terminating.  If the service's
	restarter is <code>svc.startd</code>, consult the service's log
	file; its name is based on the FMRI of the service and it is
	located in <code>/var/svc/log</code>
	(<code>/etc/svc/volatile</code> if early in boot).
	Also consult service-specific log files and documentation (use
	<code>svcs&nbsp;-x&nbsp;<i>service_fmri</i></code> to list
	documentation references for the service).

	<p>
	Once the problem is fixed, run
	<code>svcadm&nbsp;clear&nbsp;<i>service_fmri</i></code> to
	request the Solaris Service Manager to restart the service.
