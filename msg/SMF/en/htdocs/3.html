	  The Solaris Service Manager issues commands for a service to its
	  responsible restarter, which may be the Solaris Service Manager
	  itself.
	  If a service's <code>general/restarter</code> property identifies
	  a service which is not present on the system, then the Service
	  Manager will leave the service in the uninitialized state.

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<font size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-3P</b></code></font>
	indicates that the service cannot be started for the above reason.
	This outcome can indicate a misunderstanding of the
	requirements of various software components, a misconfiguration
	of the system, or a defect in Solaris.
	</p>

	<p>
	The recommended action
	for the system administrator is to attempt the remedy given in
	the Suggested Action.  In the case of failure, contact Sun
	Service with the output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and <code>svcs&nbsp;-l
	<i>service_fmri</i></code>.
