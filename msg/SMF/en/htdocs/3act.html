	  Due to a bug in <code>svc.startd</code>, changes to a service's
	  restarter do not take effect immediately.
	  There are two ways to work around the bug.

	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <ol>
	        <li>
		  If you don't have a service manifest for the service,
		  create one by running <code>svccfg&nbsp;export
		  <i>service_fmri</i> &gt; <i>service</i>.xml</code> .

	        <li>
		  Correct or delete the <code>&lt;restarter&gt;</code>
		  element of the manifest.

	        <li>
		  Delete the service from the configuration repository
		  with <code>svccfg&nbsp;delete <i>service_fmri</i></code>
		  .

		<li>
		  Recreate the service with <code>svccfg&nbsp;import
		  <i>service</i>.xml</code> .
	      </ol>

	    <li>
	      Change the restarter for the service by running
	      <code>svcadm&nbsp;delegate <i>restarter_fmri</i>
	      <i>service_fmri</i></code> .  Then restart
	      <code>svc.startd</code> by running
	      <code>pkill&nbsp;svc.startd</code> .
	  </ul>
