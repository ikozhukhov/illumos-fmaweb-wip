	<p>
	  The %DISTRO% Service Manager issues commands for a service to its
	  responsible restarter, which may be the %DISTRO% Service Manager
	  itself.
	  When a new service is created, the Service Manager initializes its
	  state to uninitialized and instructs the restarter to read the
	  service's configuration and update its state.

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<font size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-4D</b></code></font>
	indicates that the service's restarter has not read the service's
	configuration and updated its state.
