	<p>
	  Wait for a moment in case the responsible restarter is still
	  processing commands.
	  If the condition persists, try refreshing or disabling and
	  enabling the service with <code>svcadm</code>(1M).

	<p>
	  If the service remains in uninitialized, this error suggests
	  a defect in the responsible restarter.
	  Contact Sun Service with the output of <code>svcs -x</code>,
	  <code>svcs&nbsp;-l <i>restarter_service_fmri</i></code>, and
	  a core file of the restarter.
	  A core file can be generated by the <code>gcore</code>(1) utility.
