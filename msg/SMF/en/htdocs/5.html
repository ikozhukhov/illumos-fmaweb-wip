	<p>
	  The %DISTRO% Service Manager issues commands for a service to its
	  responsible restarter, which may be the %DISTRO% Service Manager
	  itself.

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
	  size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-5H</b></code></font> indicates
	that the service's restarter is not running, so commands from the
	Service Manager for the service will not be executed.
	This outcome can indicate a misunderstanding of the requirements
	of various software components, a misconfiguration of the
	system, or a defect in %DISTRO%.
        <p>
        Use <code>svcs&nbsp;-l</code> to determine the FMRI of the 
        service's restarter.  
        Use <code>svcs&nbsp;-xv</code> to see 
        an explanation for the restarter's state and to see a list of 
        services waiting for the service to start.
        See <code>svcs(1)</code> for additional syntax and <code>smf(5)</code> 
        for FMRI definition.
        <p>

	If the above Action doesn't help, use the instructions in document <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-61-203634-1&searchclause=203634">
        203634</a> to place svc.startd in debug mode and contact your service provider.
