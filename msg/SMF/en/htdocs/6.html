	<p>
	  If an error occurs while manipulating a service, the %DISTRO%
	  Service Manager will place the service in the maintenance state
	  and will not start the service.

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<font size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-63</b></code></font>
	indicates that an administrator has requested that the %DISTRO%
	Service Manager place the service in the maintenance state.
	Typically this is done with <code>svcadm&nbsp;mark maintenance
	<i>service_fmri</i></code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	If the Suggested Action does not work, contact Sun Service with the
	output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and <code>svcs&nbsp;-l
	<i>service_fmri</i></code>.
