	<p>
	The %DISTRO% Service Manager attempts to activate services on a
	%DISTRO% system based on a graph of dependencies and
	administrator intentions, using a defined set of service
	methods.  In the case that a service method fails multiple times
	in succession, the Service Manager will place the service in the
	maintenance state until administrator repairs can be carried
	out.
	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<font size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-7Y</b></code></font>
	indicates that the %DISTRO% Service Manager has classified a service in
	this way.
	</p>
	<p>
	This outcome can indicate a misunderstanding of the requirements
	of various software components, a misconfiguration of the system,
	or a defect in %DISTRO%.  The recommended action for the system
	administrator is to attempt the remedy given in the Suggested
	Action above.  In the case of failure, contact Sun Service with
	the output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and
	<code>svcs&nbsp;-l&nbsp;<i>impacted_service_fmri</i></code>.
