	<p>
	  The restarter of a service manipulates it by executing the methods
	  its configuration specifies.
	  If a method fails, the restarter may choose to retry the method,
	  or it may choose to place the service in the maintenance state, to
	  await administrative intervention.

	<p>
	  If a service's restarter is
	  <code>svc:/system/svc/restarter:default</code> and a method is
	  configured to be a program, the restarter considers the method to
	  have failed if it exits with a non-zero exit status or is
	  terminated by a signal.

	<p>
	The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<font size="+1"><code><b>SMF-8000-8Q</b></code></font>
	indicates that the service's restarter placed the service into the
	maintenance state because a method failed.
	This outcome can indicate a misunderstanding of the requirements
	of various software components, a misconfiguration of the system,
	or a defect in Solaris.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If the Suggested Action fails, contact Sun Service with the
	output of <code>svcs&nbsp;-x</code> and
	<code>svcs&nbsp;-l&nbsp;<i>service_fmri</i></code>.
