	<p>
	  Use <code>svcs&nbsp;-l <i>service_fmri</i></code> to determine the
	  restarter for the service.

	<p>
	  For services managed by
	  <code>svc:/system/svc/restarter:default</code>, collect
	data for Sun Service.  In particular, obtain a core file for
	<code>svc.startd</code> using <code>gcore</code>(1), as well
	as <code>svcs -x</code> output.  Once data has been obtained, it
	may be possible to restore service operation clearing the
	maintenance state with <code>svcadm</code>(1M).

	<p>
	For services managed by other restarters, no diagnosis may be
	available by design.  See the documentation for the relevant
	restarter for guidance.
	Running <code>svcadm&nbsp;clear <i>service_fmri</i></code> will
	request that the restarter clear the maintenance state.
	</p>
