	<item>Schedule a repair procedure to replace the affected CPU, the identity 
of which can be determined using &lt;b&gt;fmdump -v -u &amp;lt;EVENT-ID&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
to view the results of diagnosis and the specific Field Replaceable 
Unit (FRU) identified for repair.
&lt;p&gt;
The event-id can be found in the EVENT-ID field of the message.
For example:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;EVENT-ID: d05a9f16-e969-4988-d340-dea1b54bd307&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</item>

	<item>The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
indicates that the %DISTRO% Fault Manager has received reports from 
a CPU that one or more errors associated with the Level 2 cache (L2SRAM)
have been detected.  The Diagnostic Engine (DE) has triggered an 
automatic system response to disable and isolate this CPU from the 
configuration in order to prevent repeat errors and increase the 
system&#39;s total Availability.
&lt;p&gt;
Arrangements should be made to replace the Field Replaceable Unit (&lt;b&gt;FRU&lt;/b&gt;)
on which the suspect CPU is located.  Refer to the information displayed
in the &lt;b&gt;FRU:&lt;/b&gt; field of the &lt;b&gt;fmdump&lt;/b&gt; output.  For example: 
&lt;pre&gt;

# fmdump -v -u 7b146435-c3cf-c70c-9e6c-97d82bc30e18
TIME                 UUID                                 SUNW-MSG-ID
Feb 22 18:26:19.7804 7b146435-c3cf-c70c-9e6c-97d82bc30e18 SUN4U-8000-F2
  100%  fault.cpu.ultraSPARC-IIIplus.l2cachedata
         FRU: hc:///component=Slot 0
        rsrc: cpu:///cpuid=0/serial=22D1D6604A

&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example the &lt;b&gt;FRU&lt;/b&gt; would be the &lt;b&gt;CPU in slot 0&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sun Fire Midrange and High End notes:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There may be additional fault information logged by System Controller 
Application (ScApp) on Sun Fire[TM] Midrange (3800, 48x0, 6800, v1280, 
E2900, E4900, E6900) and System Management Services (SMS) on 
High End (12K, 15K, E20K, E25K) Servers.  
Availability enhancements (called AVL) have been integrated into 
ScApp 5.19.0 and SMS 1.5 to allow PSH/AVL interaction to coexist.</item>
