	<item>Schedule a repair procedure to replace the affected CPU, the identity 
of which can be determined using fmdump -v -u &amp;lt;EVENT-ID&amp;gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
The event-id can be found in the &lt;b&gt;EVENT-ID&lt;/b&gt; field of the message.
&lt;p&gt;
For example:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;EVENT-ID: 4f5d5919-2da0-ef25-b2a2-d1c433f2f832&lt;/tt&gt;

	<item>The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
indicates that the Solaris[TM] Fault Manager has received reports from 
a CPU that one or more errors associated with the Level 3 cache 
have been detected.  The Diagnostic Engine (DE) has triggered an 
automatic response to disable and isolate this CPU from the 
configuration in order to prevent repeat errors and increase the 
system&#39;s total Availability.
&lt;p&gt;
Arrangements should be made to replace the Field Replaceable Unit (FRU)
on which the suspect CPU is located.  Refer to the information displayed
in the &lt;b&gt;FRU:&lt;/b&gt; field of the &lt;b&gt;fmdump&lt;/b&gt; output.  
&lt;p&gt;
For example: 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

# fmdump -v -u 4f5d5919-2da0-ef25-b2a2-d1c433f2f832

       rsrc: mem:///component=SB16/P2/E0,J6400

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this example, the part to be replaced is the System Board in slot 16.

&lt;b&gt;Sun Fire Midrange and High End notes:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There may be additional fault information logged by System Controller 
Application (ScApp) on Sun Fire[TM] Midrange (3800, 48x0, 6800, v1280, 
E2900, E4900, E6900) and System Management Services (SMS) on 
High End (12K, 15K, E20K, E25K) Servers.  
Availability enhancements (called AVL) have been integrated into 
ScApp 5.19.0 and SMS 1.5 to allow FMA/AVL interaction to coexist.</item>
