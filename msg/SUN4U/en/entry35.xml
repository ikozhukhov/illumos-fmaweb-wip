	<item>Use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;fmdump -v -e -u &lt;i&gt;EVENT_ID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to get information 
on the detected error(s).
&lt;p&gt;
The event-id can be found in the EVENT-ID field of the message.
&lt;p&gt;
For example:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;EVENT-ID: d05a9f16-e969-4988-d340-dea1b54bd307&lt;/tt&gt;

	<item>The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
indicates that the Solaris[TM] Fault Manager has received reports that 
multiple DIMMS are experiencing errors. Open a call with your Sun Service 
provider in order to  have these errors examined further.
&lt;p&gt;
Some additional information can be gathered by running :
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;fmdump -v -e -u &lt;i&gt;EVENT_ID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
