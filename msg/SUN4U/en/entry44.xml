indicates a device connected to the hostbridge bus is faulty and requires Service.
The system may attempt to disable the faulty device and allow the rest of the 
system to continue operation.

Arrangements should be made to replace the Field Replaceable Unit (FRU)
on which the suspect resource is located.  
&lt;p&gt;
Refer to the information displayed in the FRU: field of the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;fmdump -v -u &lt;i&gt;EVENT_ID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; command to determine 
the faulty components as shown in the example below.

&lt;pre&gt;
# fmdump -v -u 719ff23c-9828-6c65-9099-ad3bf0a07c40
