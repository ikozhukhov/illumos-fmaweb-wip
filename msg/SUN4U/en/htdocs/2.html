The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="+1"><tt><b>%MSGID%</b></tt></font>
indicates the %DISTRO% Fault Manager has received reports that multiple
correctable (single bit) errors associated with a memory DIMM module
have been detected.  Diagnosis applied to the error reports has determined
that a fault requiring repair action is present. 
<p>
Schedule replacement of the affected DIMM(s) as identified in the 
<b>fmdump</b>(1M) output.  For example:
<p>

<pre>
# fmdump -v -u d05a9f16-e969-4988-d340-dea1b54bd307
TIME                 UUID                                 SUNW-MSG-ID
Aug 17 07:18:43.9562 d05a9f16-e969-4988-d340-dea1b54bd307 SUN4U-8000-2S
100%  fault.memory.dimm
       FRU: mem:///component=J0202
      rsrc: mem:///component=J0202

</pre>
<p>
Once the DIMM(s) have been replaced, the command <b>fmadm faulty
</b> should be run to see the status of the memory involved. 
<p>
Example:
<p>
<pre>
# fmadm faulty
   STATE RESOURCE / UUID
-------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
degraded mem:///component=J0202
         9f32d247-869f-c9f2-949b-d9ec88b09640
-------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
</pre>
<p>
Then <b>fmadm repair</b> should be run to remove the memory 
from the faulty list. 
<p>
<pre>
# fmadm repair mem:///component=J0202
fmadm: recorded repair to mem:///component=J0202
</pre>
<p>
See the <b>fmadm</b> man page for specific syntax 
of the command.
<p>
<b>Sun Fire Midrange and High End notes:</b>
<p>
There may be additional fault information logged by System Controller 
Application (ScApp) on Sun Fire[TM] Midrange (3800, 48x0, 6800, v1280, 
E2900, E4900, E6900) and System Management Services (SMS) on High End 
(12K, 15K, E20K, E25K) Servers.  Availability enhancements (called AVL)
have been integrated into ScApp 5.19.0 and SMS 1.5 to allow FMA/AVL 
interaction to coexist.
<p>
It is imperative that the System Controller on Sun Fire[TM] Midrange 
and High End Servers be checked for evidence of a faulty system board
to ensure that the appropriate service action is performed.
