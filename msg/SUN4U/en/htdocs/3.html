The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="+1"><tt><b>%MSGID%</b></tt></font>
that the %DISTRO% Fault Manager has received reports that one or more 
multibit, uncorrectable memory errors have been detected. Diagnosis  
has determined that a fault requiring repair action is present. 
<p>
If there are no indications of a system board or platform problem 
(See Note, below)
Schedule replacement of the affected DIMMs as identified in the 
<b>fmdump</b>(1M) output.
<pre>

% fmdump -vU d05a9f16-e969-4988-d340-dea1b54bd307

        rsrc: mem:///component=J0100,J0202,J0304,J0406


</pre>
<p>
Once the DIMMs have been replaced, the command <tt><b>fmadm faulty
</b></tt> should be run to see the status of the memory involved.
<p>
Example:
<p>

<pre>

# fmadm faulty
   STATE RESOURCE / UUID
-------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
degraded mem:///component=J0100,J0202,J0304,J0406
         d05a9f16-e969-4988-d340-dea1b54bd307
-------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

</pre>

Then <tt><b>fmadm repair</b></tt> should be run to remove the memory 
from the faulty list. 

<pre>

# fmadm repair mem:///component=J0100,J0202,J0304,J0406
fmadm: recorded repair to mem:///component=J0100,J0202,J0304,J0406

</pre>

<p>
See the <b>fmadm</b> man page for specific syntax 
of the command.
<p>
<b>Sun Fire Midrange and High End notes:</b>
<p>
There may be additional fault information logged by System Controller 
Application (ScApp) on Sun Fire[TM] Midrange (3800, 48x0, 6800, v1280, 
E2900, E4900, E6900) and System Management Services (SMS) on 
High End (12K, 15K, E20K, E25K) Servers.  
Availability enhancements (called AVL) have been integrated into 
ScApp 5.19.0 and SMS 1.5 to allow PSH/AVL interaction to coexist.
