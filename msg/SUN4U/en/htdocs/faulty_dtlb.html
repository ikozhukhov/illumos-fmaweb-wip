The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="+1"><tt><b>%MSGID%</b></tt></font>
indicates that the %DISTRO% Fault Manager has received reports from 
a CPU that one or more errors associated with the dtlb have been detected.  
The Diagnostic Engine (DE) has triggered an automatic FMA response to disable 
and isolate this CPU from the configuration in order to prevent repeat errors 
and increase the system's total Availability.
<p>
Arrangements should be made to replace the Field Replaceable Unit (FRU)
on which the suspect CPU is located.  Refer to the information displayed
in the FRU: field of the fmdump output.  For example: 
<p>
<ul>
<tt>FRU: legacy-hc:///component=Slot A</tt>
</ul>
