The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="+1"><tt><b>%MSGID%</b></tt></font>
indicates that the Solaris[TM] Fault Manager has received reports from 
a CPU that one or more errors associated with the Level 2 cache (L2SRAM)
have been detected.  The Diagnostic Engine (DE) has triggered an 
automatic response to disable and isolate this CPU from the 
configuration in order to prevent repeat errors and increase the 
system's total Availability.
<p>
Arrangements should be made to replace the Field Replaceable Unit (FRU)
on which the suspect CPU is located.  Refer to the information displayed
in the FRU: field of the fmdump output.  For example:

<b>Sun Fire Midrange and High End notes:</b>
<p>
There may be additional fault information logged by System Controller 
Application (ScApp) on Sun Fire[TM] Midrange (3800, 48x0, 6800, v1280, 
E2900, E4900, E6900) and System Management Services (SMS) on 
High End (12K, 15K, E20K, E25K) Servers.  
Availability enhancements (called AVL) have been integrated into 
ScApp 5.19.0 and SMS 1.5 to allow FMA/AVL interaction to coexist.
