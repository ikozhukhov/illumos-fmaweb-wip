The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1"><tt><b>%MSGID%</b></tt></font>
indicates a problem with the hardware and/or driver software in the PCI 
subsystem.  The most likely faulty components, as shown with <tt><b>fmdump</b></tt>,
should be repaired in order to restore the system.
<p>
If the most likely suspect is a package then run <tt><b>pkgchk</b></tt> 
on the package(s). Check for updates and patches for suspected package(s).  
Contact Sun Service if no problems are found with package or no updates 
exist.
<p>
Potentially defective software is identified in the 
<tt><b>fmdump</b></tt> output as 
follows:
<p>
<ul>
<tt>FRU: pkg:///SUNWcakr</tt>
</ul>
<p>
Potentially faulty hardware is identified in the 
<tt><b>fmdump</b></tt> output as 
follows:
<p>
<ul>
<tt>FRU: hc://product-id=SUNW,Sun-Fire-280R/motherboard=0</tt>
</ul>
<p>
If there are multiple FRU's suspected, the FRU with the highest percentage
probability should be replaced first.
