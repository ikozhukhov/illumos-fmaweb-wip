&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
indicates a diagnosis has determined that one of the cores in the 
multi-thread processor contains a faulty resource.  The diagnosis determined 
the impact of the fault is localized to a single thread that 
is being removed from service.  However, the faulty resource is shared
 by all four threads in the core.  There is the potential 
for the other threads sharing this resource to experience an error.  
It is recommended that the system administrator contact Sun support and 
arrange for the replacement of the affected component.
&lt;p&gt;
The physical thread number reported by the fault manager may not be the 
same as the logical thread number reported by Solaris.  In the example
below, the physical thread number is 8 while the logical thread number
is 4.
