	<item>An uncorrectable problem was detected in the IO hostbridge in which a mismatch
in the SW and FW prevents the error to be properly handled.
</item>
	<name>details</name>
	<item>The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;font color = &quot;RED&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;indicates a problem was detected 
in the IO hostbridge. However, no diagnosis was possible and there 
was a system panic.
&lt;p&gt;
The inability to diagnose the problem was a result of one of
the following issues:
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- The latest firmware revision is not installed.
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- The latest PX driver is not installed.
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- There is a mismatch between the revisions of the firmware and PX driver.
&lt;p&gt;
Use the command &amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;fmdump -eV -u &lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;EVENT_ID&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;
with the &amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color = &quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;EVENT_ID&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; from the PSH console message
to list the error report associated with the fault.  Have this information
available when contacting Sun for support.
