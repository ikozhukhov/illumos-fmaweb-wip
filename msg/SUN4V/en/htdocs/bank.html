The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font color = "RED"><font size="+1"><tt><b>%MSGID%</b></tt></font></font>
indicates one or more uncorrectable memory errors occurred. The memory
pages associated with the uncorrectable errors have been retired.  However,
 the system is at risk of incurring additional uncorrectable errors.
 There may be two memory DIMMs associated with the error.  Replace both DIMMs
as soon as possible. 
<p>
Use the command <tt><b>fmdump -v -u <font color = "BLUE">&lt;EVENT_ID&gt;</font></b></tt>&nbsp;
with the &nbsp;<tt><b><font color = "BLUE">&lt;EVENT_ID&gt;</font></b></tt>&nbsp; from the console message to locate the faulty DIMMs.
Depending on the platform the fault was diagnosed on, the location of the
 faulty DIMMs will be displayed in one of two ways.  For some platforms, 
the output of fmdump will appear as follows: 
<p>
<pre>
fmdump -v -u <font color = "BLUE">d5b2eeda-ff44-622f-b794-969dbd2082fe</font>  
TIME                 UUID                                 SUNW-MSG-ID

        rsrc: mem:///component=MB/CMP0/CH0:R0/D0/J0601,R0/D1/J0701
</pre>
<p>
In this example, the location of the two DIMMs are:
<p>
<pre>
MB/CMP0/CH0:R0/D0/J0601
MB/CMP0/CH0:R0/D1/J0701
</pre>
<p>
The alternate format for the output of fmdump for this fault is:
<p>
<pre>
fmdump -v -u  <font color = "BLUE">b277ec2e-55b6-ea0b-8c88-aaff3ba7fa9a</font>

<p>
In this example the FRU includes a part number field:
<p>
<pre>part=371-2143-01 Rev01</pre> 
<p>
This is the part number of the faulty 
DIMM.  The locations of the two DIMMs in this example are specified 
in the “Location” field for each fault DIMM:
<p>
<pre>
MB/CMP0/BR1: CH1/D0/J1601
MB/CMP0/BR1: CH0/D0/J1401
</pre>
<p>
Refer to the Service Manual or the Service Label attached to the server
chassis to find the physical location of the DIMMs. Some platforms also 
provide fault indicators for individual DIMMs to validate the location.  
Once the DIMMs have
been replaced, use the Service Manual and Product Notes for instructions 
on clearing the fault condition and validating the repair action.
