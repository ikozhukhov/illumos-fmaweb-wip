The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font color = "RED"><font size="+1"><tt><b>%MSGID%</b></tt></font></font>
indicates diagnosis has determined that a memory DIMM is faulty as a 
result of exceeding the threshold for correctable memory errors.  Memory
pages associated with the correctable errors have been retired and no 
data has been lost.  
<p>
Use the command <tt><b>fmdump -v -u <font color = "BLUE">&lt;EVENT_ID&gt;</font></b></tt>&nbsp;
with the &nbsp;<tt><b><font color = "BLUE">&lt;EVENT_ID&gt;</font></b></tt>&nbsp; from the console message to locate the faulty DIMM.
Depending on the platform the fault was diagnosed on, the location of the
 faulty DIMM will be displayed in one of two ways.  For some platforms, 
the output of fmdump will appear as follows: 
<p>
<pre>
fmdump -v -u <font color = "BLUE">f92e9fbe-735e-c218-cf87-9e1720a28004</font>
TIME                 UUID                                 SUNW-MSG-ID

        rsrc: mem:///component=MB/CMP0/CH0:R0/D0/J0601 
</pre>
<p>
In this example, the DIMM location is:
<p>
<pre>
MB/CMP0/CH0:R0/D0/J0601
</pre>
<p>
The alternate format for the output of fmdump for this fault is:
<p>
<pre>
fmdump -v -u  <font color = "BLUE">b277ec2e-55b6-ea0b-8c88-aaff3ba7fa9a</font>

       Location: MB/CMP0/BR1: CH1/D0/J1601
</pre>
In this example the FRU includes a part number field:
<p>
<pre>part=371-2143-01 Rev01</pre> 
<p>
This is the part number of the faulty 
DIMM.  The location of the DIMM in this example is specified 
in the “Location” field:
<p>
<pre>
MB/CMP0/BR1: CH1/D0/J1601
</pre>
<p>
Refer to the Service Manual or the Service Label attached to the server
chassis to find the physical location of the DIMM.  Some platforms also 
provide fault indicators for individual DIMMs to validate the location.  
 Once the DIMM has
been replaced, use the Service Manual for instructions on clearing the 
fault condition and validating the repair action.
