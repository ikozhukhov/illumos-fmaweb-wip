indicates a diagnosis has determined that one of the threads
in the multi-thread processor is faulty.  The fault manager arranged an 
automated attempt to disable this thread.  The diagnosis determined 
the fault is localized to a single thread that is being 
removed from service.  However, it is recommended that the system 
administrator contact Sun support and arrange for the replacement of the 
affected component.
<p>
The physical thread number reported by the fault manager may not be the 
same as the logical thread number reported by Solaris.  In the example
below, the physical thread number is 8 while the logical thread number
is 4.
