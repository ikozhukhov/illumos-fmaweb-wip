The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="+1"><tt><b>%MSGID%</b></tt></font>
indicates the Solaris Fault Manager has received reports that
correctable memory errors attributed to a single page of physical
memory have been detected.  Diagnosis applied to the error reports
has determined that a fault is present, although no repair action is
needed at this time.  No data has been lost.  If and when the Solaris
Fault Manager determines that there is sufficient cause, service action
will be recommended at that time.
