	<item>The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt; indicates that errors were previously detected, but the module responsible for diagnosing those errors was unable to resume diagnosis after a restart.  This may be caused more commonly by a corrupted checkpoint file, downrev or incompatible revisions of software, or less frequently by bugs in the diagnosis module or subsystem.&lt;P&gt;

	Remove the diagnosis engine checkpoint file '/var/fm/fmd/ckpt/eft/eft', repair this defect using 'fmadm acquit &amp;lt;EVENT_ID&amp;gt;', and restart the fault manager using 'svcadm restart'.  If the problem reoccurs after having done this, contact your service provider.</item>
