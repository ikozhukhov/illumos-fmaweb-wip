	<item>The Message ID:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;%MSGID%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt; indicates that errors were detected, but the module responsible for diagnosing those errors was unable to perform a diagnosis due to exceeding a defined limit.  This may be caused more commonly by a limit having been defined in the diagnosis engine configuration file for the maximum number of fault management exercises, downrev or incompatible revisions of software, or less frequently by bugs in the diagnosis module or subsystem.&lt;P&gt;

	Check the diagnosis engine configuration file '/usr/lib/fm/fmd/plugins/eft.conf' and ensure that the 'maxfme' variable is not set, then repair this defect using 'fmadm acquit &amp;lt;EVENT_ID&amp;gt;', and restart the fault manager using 'svcadm restart'.  If the problem reoccurs after having having done this, contact your service provider.</item>
