	Use the standard Solaris interactive installation program to
	upgrade your system.  See Chapter 3, Solaris Installation and
	Upgrade (Planning) in
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-5505/&quot;&gt;
	Solaris 10 Installation Guide: Solaris Live Upgrade and Upgrade Planning
	&lt;/a&gt;,

	&lt;/a&gt;.
	Note that the media used for the installation must be either a
	DVD or a network installation image created from a DVD.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	Use the custom JumpStart installation program to upgrade your
	system.  See Chapter 3, Solaris Installation and Upgrade
	(Planning) in
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-5505/&quot;&gt;
	Solaris 10 Installation Guide: Solaris Live Upgrade and Upgrade Planning
	&lt;/a&gt;,
	and Chapter 11, Custom JumpStart (Reference) in
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-5506/&quot;&gt;
	Solaris 10 Installation Guide:
	Custom JumpStart and Advanced Installations
	&lt;/a&gt;.
	Note that the media used for the installation must be either a
	DVD or a network installation image created from a DVD.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	Save all application data, uninstall all of the existing
	non-global zones, and use any installation method to upgrade
	your system.  All of the non-global zones and their
	applications must then be reinstalled.  This option is
	basically an upgrade of the global zone using any installation
	method, including Live Upgrade, and an initial install of all
	the non-global zones.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	Choose to wait for Solaris Live Upgrade to be supported on your
	system configuration in a future release.  With this option,
	specific patches for issues of concern can still be installed
	at this time.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
