indicates errors were detected but the module responsible for
diagnosing those errors was unable to arrive at a diagnosis.
This may be caused more commonly by downrev or incompatible revisions  
of software, or less frequently by bugs in the diagnosis module or subsystem.   
If all patches appear to be current and all dependencies are properly
addressed, error telemetry will need to be examined by Service personnel 
to make a further determination of the problem.  Please see the 
information below for certain platform specific patch requirements.
<P>
For T1000,T2000,Netra T2000,T5120,and T5220 systems, please make sure
that the firmware patch levels are as follows:
<P>
T5120 and T5220 firmware patch 127580-05 or higher
<P>
T2000 firmware patch 136927-01 or higher
<P>

On Sun SPARC Enterprise Mx000 systems,  
please check the output of "showstatus" and "fmdump" from the xscfu for 
possible hardware faults.
<P>
On Sun Fire 12K, 15K, 20K and E25K systems, please check the output of
