The Message ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1"><tt><b>%MSGID%</b></tt></font>
indicates that errors were detected, but the module responsible for
diagnosing those errors was unable to perform a diagnosis.
This is typically due to problems in the topology, error telemetry, and/or
diagnosis rules.  This may be caused more commonly by downrev or incompatible
revisions  of software and/or firmware, or less frequently by bugs in the
diagnosis module or subsystem.   
<P>
The Solaris Kernel and Predictive Self-Healing (PSH) patches are particularly
critical, and should be examined.  Ensure that the latest patches are
installed, and that any dependencies documented in the patch README files
are noted and addressed.
Check <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/show.do?target=home">'SunSolve'</a>
patch finder for patches with 'fma' and/or 'eft.so' keywords. 
<P>
Also, please make sure that the firmware patch levels are up to date for the
following systems.
<P>
	<UL>
	<LI>	T5120 and T5220: firmware patch 127580-05 or higher
		<P>
	<LI>	T2000: firmware patch 136927-01 or higher
		<P>
	<LI>	Netra T2000: firmware patch 136929-01 or higher
		<P>
	<LI>	T1000: firmware patch 127577-03 or higher
	</UL>
<P>
<b>Please Note -</b> On some systems there could be additional 
information that may indicate a hardware fault. If this is the
case then it is possible that this defect is a result of the
service processor diagnosing a fault and deconfiguring a device.
<P>
	<UL>
	<LI>	On Sun SPARC Enterprise Mx000 systems,  please check the
		output of 'showstatus' and 'fmdump' from the XSCFU for
		information about possible hardware faults.
		<P>
	<LI>	On Sun Fire 12K, 15K, 20K and E25K systems, please check
		the output of  'showlogs -E -p e list 3' from the main system
		controller for information about possible hardware faults.
		<P>
	<LI>	On Sun Fire 3800, 48x0, 6800, v1280, E2900, E4900, E6900,
		and Netra 1280/1290 systems, please check the output of
		'showlogs -v' from the main system controller for information
		about possible hardware faults.
	</UL>
<P>
If there is no indication of the service processor having diagnosed a fault
and having deconfigured a device, and all patches appear to be current and
all dependencies are properly addressed, error telemetry will need to be
examined by Service personnel to make a further determination of the problem.
