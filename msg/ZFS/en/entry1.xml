&lt;p&gt;ZFS keeps a list of active pools on the filesystem to avoid having to
scan all devices when the system is booted.  If this file is corrupted, then
normally active pools will not be automatically opened.  The pools can be
recovered using the 'zpool import' command:

&lt;pre&gt;
# zpool import
  pool: test
    id: 12743384782310107047
 state: ONLINE
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.
config:

        test              ONLINE
          c0t0d0          ONLINE
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will automatically scan &lt;tt&gt;/dev/dsk&lt;/tt&gt; for any
devices part of a pool.  If devices have been made available in an alternate
location, use the '-d' option to 'zpool import' to search for devices in a
different directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have determined which pools are available for import, you can
import the pool explicitly by specifying the name or numeric
identifier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
# zpool import test
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternately, you can import all available pools by specifying the
'-a' option.  Once a pool has been imported, the ZFS cache will be repaired so
that the pool will appear normally in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
