&lt;p&gt;If this error is seen during 'zpool import', see the section below.
Otherwise, run 'zpool status -x' to determine which pool is faulted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
# zpool status -x
  pool: test
 state: FAULTED
status: The ZFS version for the pool is incompatible with the software running
        on this system.
action: Destroy and re-create the pool.
 scrub: none requested

&lt;p&gt;The pool cannot be used on this system.  Either move the storage to the
system where the pool was originally created, upgrade the current system
software to a more recent version, or destroy the pool and re-create it from
backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this error is seen during import, the pool cannot be imported on the
current system.  The disks must be attached to the system which originally
created the pool, and imported there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of currently supported versions can be displayed using 'zpool
upgrade -v'.&lt;/p&gt;
