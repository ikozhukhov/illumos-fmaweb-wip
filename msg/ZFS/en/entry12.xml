&lt;p&gt;A device within a ZFS pool failed and could not be reopened.  Running
'zpool status -x' will provide more detailed information about the particular
failure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
# zpool status -x
  pool: test
 state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices could not be used because the label is missing or
        invalid.  Sufficient replicas exist for the pool to continue
        functioning in a degraded state.
action: Replace the device using 'zpool replace'.
   see: &lt;font color='red'&gt;http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-4J&lt;/font&gt;
