&lt;p&gt;
The pool has experienced I/O failures. Since the ZFS pool property 'failmode'
is set to 'wait', all I/Os (reads and writes) are blocked.  See the zpool(1M)
manpage for more information on the 'failmode' property.  Manual intervention
is required for I/Os to be serviced.  You can see which devices are
affected by running 'zpool status -x':
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
# zpool status -x
  pool: test
 state: FAULTED
status: There are I/O failures.
action: Make sure the affected devices are connected, then run 'zpool clear'.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-HC
 scrub: none requested
config:

        NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        test        FAULTED      0    13     0  insufficient replicas
          c0t0d0    FAULTED      0     7     0  experienced I/O failures
          c0t1d0    ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: 1 data errors, use '-v' for a list
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After you have made sure the affected devices are connected, run 'zpool clear'
to allow I/O to the pool again:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
# zpool clear test
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If I/O failures continue to happen, then applications and commands  for the
pool may hang.  At this point, a reboot may be necessary to allow I/O to the
pool again.
&lt;/p&gt;
