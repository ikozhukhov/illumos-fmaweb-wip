This directory contains files exported via the http://sun.com/msg website.
When the "ergen" command constructs the directory tree of information
used by that site (known as the "msgdoc" tree), all the files in this
directory are copied to the root of the msgdoc tree.

Things found in this directory:

	a.gif         -- 1x1 pixel image used for formatting the web pages
	default.css   -- style sheet for all sun.com/msg pages
	footer        -- common footer for all sun.com/msg pages
	header        -- common header for all sun.com/msg pages
	index.cgi     -- the program that displays the appropriate article
	logo_sun.gif  -- sun logo for common header
	msgindex.html -- the file that sun.com/msg displays when misconfigured
	pullmsgdoc    -- Perl script that pulls in msgdoc tree (run via cron)
	s10-small.gif -- pretty solaris 10 image for sun.com/msg main page
