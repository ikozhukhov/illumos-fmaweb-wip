Across the board, Sun products ensure business-critical applications and
essential system services can run without interruption in the event of 
software failures, degradation or failure of major hardware components 
and even issues with software configuration.
<p>
Whether it be an enterprise server, a storage appliance or even the Solaris 
Operating System itself, the Predictive Self Healing capabilities ensure 
optimal availability and overall improvements in system management, 
maintenance and repair.
<p>
You can learn more about Sun's Predictive Self Healing technologies from 
the following sources:

<li>Predictive Self-Healing in the Solaris 10 Operating System (<a href="http://sun.com/software/solaris/ds/self_healing.pdf">PDF</a>)

A self-healing system will typically direct an administrator to a 
knowledge article to learn more about a problem impact or repair 
procedure. You can access the knowledge article corresponding to a 
self-healing message by taking the Sun Message Identifier 
(SUNW-MSG-ID) and entering it into the field on this page, or by 
appending it to the link <tt>%MSGURL%/</tt> in your web browser.
<p>
The message IDs used by self-healing components resemble the following example:
<p>
<ul>
SUNW-MSG-ID: <i>NAME</i><tt>-XXXX-XX</tt>
</ul>
<p>
The <i>NAME</i> identifies a system type or software component, and is
followed by a series of groups of letters and numbers (X) separated by dashes.
Some IDs are longer and contain additional <tt>XXXX-</tt> sequences.
To retrieve a knowledge article, enter the message ID below:
<p>
<form method="post" action="%MSGURL%/">
SUNW-MSG-ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;<input name="msgid" maxLength="200" size="40">&nbsp;&nbsp;<input type="submit" value="Lookup"><br>
</form>
